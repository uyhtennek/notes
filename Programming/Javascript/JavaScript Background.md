# Background

* modern programming language
	* have been around just about as long as Python
	* invented in the mid 1990s
		* a few years after Python (1991)
* derived from the syntax at C

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript make up the most of the user experience on the web


**Tech stuff**

To start writing JavaScript, just open up a file with the .js file extension
* unlike PHP

Our website will know that our file is JavaScript, because we'll explicitly tell it
* like using an HTML tag `<script>`

JavaScript applications run *client-side*, on our own machine
* while Python runs *server-side*

# Implement to HTML

1. `<script>`
* Just like we can directly write CSS code inside [[CSS Explained#Implementation|`<style>`]] tags
* We can directly write JavaScript between `<script>` tags

2. `<script src="...">`
* Also just like CSS that we can [[CSS Explained#Implementation|link a separate CSS file]]
* We can write our JavaScript in separate files and link them in by using the `<script>` tags
* this is the preferred way to go
