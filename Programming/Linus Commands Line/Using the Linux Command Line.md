# Linux

a example of *Linux OS* is *Ubuntu*
* which the [CS50 IDE](https://code.cs50.io) used, which is a cloud-based machine
* one of the many flavors

Many modern Linux distributions have *graphical user interfaces (GUI)*
to allows easy mouse-based navigation.
like how we use Windows or Mac OS

but as a programmer we should be familiar with *terminal window* and *keyboard commands*

**important**
Linux commands require **UNIX-based** system.
Mac is UNIX-based, so terminal in Mac uses those commands.
Windows however is not, so Windows Command Prompt works differently and those commands won't work on Windows.
