# Program Files
This directory contains most our 64-bit programs.

# Program Files (x86)
This directory instead contains our 32-bit programs.

# Users
Every user has his own profile.
So like if I set-up 3 users in my computer. The Users folder will look somthing like:
```shell
Users
> Public
> Default
> Kenneth
> Mom
> Dad
```
where Public and Default are set-up by Windows.
