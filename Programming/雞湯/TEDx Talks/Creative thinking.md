# Easy is very hard

Your boss just comes up to you and say,
"hea give me some ideas. think out of the box!"

it sounds easy, but it's hard
* it needs practice
	* on how to get out of the box
	* on how to get back inside the box, because that's where we live
___

# Why?
First of all, ask this question, why you should think out of the box?

because by thinking out of the box
* you're risking
* inside the box, everything is firm and sturdy

so why you need to risk it?
* it's simple, since you need something different to stand out
___

# Which box?
Then, what is the box actually?

It's a boundary within our minds
* a boundary between us and what we know, but yet we somehow still haven't thought about

Years and years of direct and indirect experience construct our thinking habit
* it feels safe to think with what we're familiar with
* it feels risky, to search things outside of that, because nobody knows what is out there
___

# How?
how to get out of the box?

Whenever we need to think about an area, usually we're so focused into it,
that we have ideas on how things should be already
* we have requirements, specifications, we know how things are
* because that's the way they always have been

To go out of the box, we need to add something to it
* like, something beyond the area, something wrong, something absurd, something irrelevant...
* something, which takes us far

inside the box is all convergent information,
to get of it, we need to bring in, divergent information

The thing is, we don't know where to go with that information
* that thought is so irrelevant that, we think we should just immediately go back
* "That doesn't make any sense. Let's get back to the safe place."
* and we need to resist that

For that, we need to have long thinking
* normally we value, brilliant thinking, fast thinking, deep thinking
* here, the solution is not something near, so we need to take the time to go far

While we're thinking, look for alternative, not answer
* because creativity has no answer
* but it has many possible alternatives
___

# What?
so you now came up with an idea, but what is its value? is it any good?

It's difficult to say, because it's very new
* you've never seen that, others may not as well
	* it's like a new planet, a totally undiscovered territory
* and we don't feel like clever enough to know its value
* and probably the idea has been thought about before by someone else
	* if it's good, why not somebody would have done it before me?

These thoughts are natural, but these can kill our own ideas
* so we need to resist them as well

There are really just two ways that a new idea can generate value
1. the new idea benefits our initial drive, our initial focus, in some way
2. the idea per se is quite valuable, that it probably would be a good idea for another problem
	* it may not be your problem though, serendipity 機緣巧合 happens all the time
___

# When?
eventually, we need to bring the new idea to the world, but when?

Your idea is not something familiar to others, most of them are not gonna like it
So when is a good time to challenge everybody around you?
* you can't just bring random ideas to your boss, they expect "good" ideas

First of all, if the environment punishes mistakes, you will never be tempted to go out of the box
so if you need creative ideas, then you need a creative environment, which allows random thoughts
___

# Experiment
thinking out of the box often times happen really fast

1. we want to generate new ideas about TEDx Conferences

2. we start from the convergent information about TEDx Conferences
* what is needed to make a good TEDx conference?
* a good speaker, a good theme, fast speaker-to-speaker transitions, set-up a good stage, ....

3. now we can apply the divergent modifier
* to any of these convergent elements
* eg. we want to *exaggerate* the *grand settings*, bring it to the limit
	* maybe instead of making a TEDx conferences in a theater, we make it happen in a stadium

4. Does this make any sense?
* it's difficult to organize, it's difficult to fill the place, ....

5. Although it seems impossible, it probably have a solution.
* how about, the place is already filled with people?
	* like, having a TEDx Conference at half-time of football matches?


## another experiment

3. let's take another element
* maybe we can eliminate the good, brilliant speakers?

4. Does this make any sense?
* No.

5. But, does this lead to anything useful?
* so we can't have speakers, but we still need the speeches, the scripts
* maybe we can have the speakers give the scripts to others and give the talk?
* so it's a cooperative TEDx Conference
	* maybe the speech can benefit from having two people's opinions?
		* since there is no ego anymore
