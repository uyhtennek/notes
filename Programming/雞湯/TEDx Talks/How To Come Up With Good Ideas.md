# 1. Be Curious

> [!quote] -Isaac Asimov
> The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not "eureka", but "that's funny"

The first step is always, observing the world around us
* kids are probably the most creative group of people
* they're always questioning, looking and observing, and making connections about the world
* it's valuable, but often times not valued

eg. Jony Ive, the head designer at Apple, said
* for him, it's always like a curse
* when he looks at objects and designs and stuff, he always ask,
	* "why is that that way, not his way?"
* and he just can't turn this off

and Apple does have product that just seem different, right?
* a lot of times we pictured almost like there's a hill and everyone's trying to optimize to get to the top of the hill
* and then Apple sometimes just step back and be like, "oh look, there's another hill over here"

> The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas, as escaping from old ones.

a lot of times people can look at a design and be like
"wow, how did nobody think of that before?"

the idea of microwave came from a chocolate bar melting in a pocket
* there are many people who had chocolate bar melted in their pockets
* but only that one guy do something about it and invented microwave

# 2. Work Hard

The Marshmallow Challenge
* the idea is that, you have some daily life tools, some mintues, now build the tallest tower and put a marshmallow on top
* again, kindergartners beat CEOs, lawyers, and businessman on this one

But why? Is adult that bad?
* The adults, looking at the situation, and the first three minutes just like a power struggle
	* making decisions like who's gonna be the leader
* And then they start building, and the thing is, they don't actually put the marshmallow on, until the very end
	* and the real thing is, marshmallow is deceptively heavy, it makes the whole structure buckles
	* and then they just have a minute or so left so they can't do anything
* kindergartners, on the other hand, no power struggle, and usually like 4 or 5 minutes or so they already putting the marshmallow on top to sort of testing
* this is actually, literally, consistently, the case

Apple, behind the scene, has like forty devices prototypes, that we never see
* Thomas Edison said he came up with 10,000 light bulbs before he found one that worked
* James Dyson said he had 5,127 failed prototypes before he had a vacuum that actually sucked

so whatever you do, do a lot, fail a lot, learn a lot
* it's all about iterations
___

# 3. Get Lucky

There is a book called "Good To Great"
* his author interviewed a bunch of CEOs, and ten of them are from these companies that supposed to be awesome and never fail
* he tried to find that common thread amoung these CEOs, things that connected all of them
* all ten of them mentioned, a lot of what happened
	* things just get lucky
	* certainly their skills are there, but lucky really is a thing

We human, don't like that idea
* we like to connect things, make sense of things
* almost like as if we can do the same if we were them and know the how

eg. if we give a coin to someone can tell them to flip it ten times
* eventually, someone can get ten heads or tails in a row
* and then the media would swoop in and say stuffs like
	* "look at his flip technique, look at his fingers and the way his wrist was, his elbow, ...."
* that's what we do, that's human

so, remember, there's things that out of our control

however, if you're Thomas Edison, you wouldn't be like "I've build 9,999 light bulbs, I give up."
* because you trust the process

so, ultimately, keep working, keep iterating, keep improving,
and expect to be lucky
