# Keep the team moving forward

EA spent huge amount of effort ensuring that the team, 50-100 people in size, was always able to move forward effectively

* everyone is able to test their work locally and quickly
* everyone is able to run the game at any given time and on any platform
* the game should not break, even when feeded with bad data
	* and errors should be made clear to the user
* all work should be tested locally before given to the rest of the team
* be aware of the potential impact of your work to the team, and talk to them about it
	* communicate!
* finding bottlenecks and issues
	* raise awareness to help find a solution, as a team
___

# Taking baby steps
design through iterative prototyping

1. start with the core mechanics or the largest unknown
2. work outwards to build up the game or feature
3. move onto the next step once a feature is 'finished' or the unknown is answered

* it's okay to quickly hack something together if you want to see if something works
	* feedbacks from people are much more important than doing things 'right'
	* we can always tidy things up once it has been proven
* let the feedback help drive the design
	* design should be an iterative process
	* review and change the design regularly based on feedback from the build

# Everything is done for a reason

past work or decision that is done or made would have been for a reason at the time
* it may have been 'wrong' or no longer valid, but it will exist

our instinct is to fix it, because we're telling ourselves that it's a mistake
but that mindset can mislead us from working on the actual task we were meant to be doing

> [!example] The worst game in video game history
> E.T on the Atari 2600 is a notorious game. However, once you read about the how and why the game was developed, the game mechanics that were implemented and the very short time frame that the developer had, it becomes a lot harder to call it a 'failure'.
> 
> Another developer has since taken the game and fixed some of the gameplay issues and bugs present. It then is a much better game.

understand and appreciate the decisions and/or context, it helps us making better and more complete work

# You don't have to know everything
we're not expected to anyway

most companies are very understanding of this, and will allow some flexibility
* as long as you have the fundamentals
* and a willingness to learn

you have these two assets, then you're proven valuable
___

# The user isn't you

there's a good chance that your product is only been tested along the 'happy path', the path that you expected it to be used or played

when it get to somebody else's hand, they start doing random things that you hadn't expected
* that's very normal, simply because the user isn't you
* they have no idea how the thing should be used or played

so, anticipate the unexpected path
* it's get better with practice
* and put it in the hands of someone else
	* could be a co-worker, or just someone random
___

# Use emojis and images

plain text is easy to misunderstand
* emojis can help a lot with tone and inject some personality

A picutre is worth a thousand words and GIFs, even more so.
An image as the first message of a conversation helps so much in establishing the context.
If all these fails, try to get on a call with them or have a face to face chat.
