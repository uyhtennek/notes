# 1. Burn the Ships
burn your choices

eg. if you want to launch your own business
* begin by making the commitment to quitting your job
	* write a letter of resignation
	* give it to a trusted friend, tell them to mail the letter by a certain date
		* if you haven't quit the job already

eg. One Las Vegas casino manager quit smoking by putting up words on a billboard
* "If you catch me smoking, I'll pay you $100,000!"
* with his photo on it

this is called *willpower leveraging*
* use a small bit of willpower to establish a consequence that will virtually compel you to keep your commitment

eg. The Art of War 孫子兵法, by Sun Tzu
* soldiers fight the most ferociously when they believe they're fighting to the death
* create the illusion of a potential escape route for the enemy, so they won't fight as hard

If you don't burn the ships, you're telling yourself "it's okay to quit"
* when things go inevitably tough, you will, quit
___

# 2. Make Desire Boosters

eg. if you want to lose weight, make your own posters that say, "I weigh X pounds"
* where X is your goal weight
* put them up around your house
* likewise, get some pictures of people who have nice bodies similar to what you'd like to have, and put them up around your house
* likewise, do the same in your office
* .......
___

# 3. Find Positive People

Make friends who will encourage you on the path to your goals
* also spend more time with them
* only share your goals with people who will support you
	* not those who will respond with cynicism or indifference

eg. if you want to lose weight, get into a gym, make friends with people who are in great shape
* you can learn from them, and kinda be like them
* you'll start believing that you can do it too

eg. if you want to start a new business, join the local chamber of commerce or a trade association
* make friends

Also, you need to fire the negative people from your life
* it can be diffcult for some people though
* "You can see your future just by looking at the six people with whom you spend the most time."
	* if you don't like what you see, change those people
* don't be loyal to people who expect you to fail
* eg. one of the reasons people fail to start their own businesses, is that they spend most of their time associating with other employees (or friends i guess?)
	* you'll need to spend a lot more time associating with business owners
	* by joining a trade association
	* because you need the mindsets, and you need to find that from some kind of role models

# 4. Feed Your Mind, Daily

eg. if you want to quit smoking, read books written by ex-smokers on how to quit the habit
eg. if you want to start a business, start devouring business books
* go to seminars on occasion

basically, read some 雞湯 regularly, like at least 15 minutes a day
* it recharges your batteries and keep your desire impenetrably strong

when you absorb material created by an extremely passionate person, you'll feel more passionate as well
* eg. read "Pour Your Heart Into It" by Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks
* eg. Harvey Mackay and Zig Ziglar
___

# 5. Replace Sources of Negativity

some stuffs in our life can generate negativity, replace those with things that generate positivity
* eg. avoid watching TV news, because it's overwhelmingly negative
* eg. avoid dark, tragic movies that leave you feeling empty afterwards

the big idea is, spend less time worrying
* if you have a hard time motivating yourself, chances are that your life is overflowing with many sources of negativity

another big idea is, it's better to *happily achieve* than to feel you must achieve in order to be happy
