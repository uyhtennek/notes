[Techniques for dealing with lack of motivation, malaise, depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7kh8pNRWOo)

sometimes some months after starting projects, you know you still want to do it because it'd be cool, but somehow just feeling down about it and feeling bummed
* as a result can't work effectively

the idea basically is like turning down the volume of depression
* using a divide-and-conquer approach
* much like engineering

# Nature of programming

computer is kinda depressing
* let alone staring at a monitor and talk to no one in days or even months
	* in addition our body is not borned to be sharped to a chair
* the tasks are intense as well, in both the amount of work and the quality of work
* also if someone is depressed they're likely not going to tell you about the depression

# Dividing depression

we can very boardly dividing negativity to either thoughts or emotions
* negative thoughts are like, oh my god this project is taking too long, I woudn't be able to finish it and it would bankrupt me and fail, no body will respect me and everybody will judge me
* negative emotions have a physically part in it, so that's something we can do about

# Dealing with thoughts

when times that you feel very bad come,
we can be trapped in negative thoughts and they seem to be very hard to get away from.

but actually we can stand apart from them very easily
just sit down comfortably and observe your surroundings and let random thoughts out
* you notice you won't be heavily thinking about things that are bothering
* you notice small things in the place and thoughts pop out

practice a few times then you start realising thoughts are just thoughts
* yes they are in our head, but they are not we are, how we think
	* they just carry out our mind
* they are something that you know and you can control
	* you can see how heavy is a thought
	* can you let that thought go or how long before that thought go away, ....

# Dealing with emotions

emotion has a certain physical part in it,
so when emotions come, we can distract ourselve by feeling some other physical part that we're also sensing from the environment
