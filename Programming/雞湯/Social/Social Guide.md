# How To Be Less Quiet?
there will be situations that may require you to be chattier and more outgoing


## Take small steps

basically, just talk
* leave your desk and exchange a few words with your coworkers
* respond "good" to "how are you?"
	* then tell your story, whatever it is


## Find Inspiration

"It's cold oustide today"
"The food smells good"
"Is that a new jacket? I like it!"

you'd have thoughts against your surroundings, share that with others


## Challenge your thoughts

if you caught yourself think, "people never listen to me anyway" or "I don't want to talk to these people anyway"
* challenge those thoughts
* tell yourself, "no, you're wrong, now speak"
	* and find evidence to prove that


## Be mindful of your thoughts

mindfulness is when you focus your attention on the now without judging it
* mindfully observe yourself, then maybe you can dig deep and discover some inner thoughts

eg. you might find you have a thought pattern that talks you out of interacting with people
* then, again, you can challenge these thoughts


## Find Quiet Places

big, crowded spaces are not your thing
meeting someone on a one to one basis is much more easier for you

i guess it's kinda like taking small steps
* connect to others in a place where you have advantages
* connect enough then it's easier when it's the time you're in disadvantages


## Use realistic affirmations

Try to come up with a new way of looking at the situation
* prepare some positive affirmations in advance
* eg. if you feel like you're not interesting enough for people to talk to, tell yourself, "I can make valuable contributions"
* don't make unbelievable affirmations though because it makes you feel worse


## Project your voice

you need to speak louder


## Try therapy

maybe you need a CBT, *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy*
* you probably don't, but...

# In The Workplace

in workplace, a little socializing goes a long way
* you should know your co-workers as people instead of just work colleagues

at least these steps will show that you're attempting to make an effort
* you get to be more social

# The Bright Side

quiet isn't all bad
it's likely that when you do speak, you offer up the best of what you have to give

if you listen more, you learn others stories more
people may even seek you out because you're a listener
others may come to you for advice because they see you as an insightful person
quiet people choose people to connect with, others are hard to connect with quiet people
