# Hot reload

We can actually change code while the Unity editor is in play mode
* then the execution will be paused, the current game state saved
* then the scripts are compiled again, and finally the game state is reloaded and play resumes

* it is known as a hot reload
* but not everything survives a hot reload
* some survived will just switch to doing its new behavior
	* without being aware that something changed

# Function Library

currently we have a class `Graph`, to display a sine wave
if we want it to do maybe a cosine wave, we can use hot reload
however, if we want it switch back and forth between multiple functions, that wouldn't be handy

it would be nice if we can change the function via a configuration option of the graph
* we could declare multiple mathematical functions inside `Graph`
* but it is better to dedicate `Graph` to just displaying a function
	* leaving it unaware of the exact mathmatical equations
* this is an example of specialization and separation of concerns

1. Create a new `FunctionLibrary` C# script
* it is a collection of publicly-accessible methods that represent math functions
	* sort of like `Mathf`
* so it is not going to be a component type
* since we don't want this class to be used as an object template, we mark it as static
