# Optimize while developing

> [!warning] Don't do it yet
> Generally, we don't need to do optimization during development. Because the computers are probably fast enough to recover from our poor optimization. But it assumes that the computation power of the end user's machine and the developer's machine are about the same.

However, for mobile, the hardware is more limited than the computers we are used to working with, so we need to have that in mind during the development
