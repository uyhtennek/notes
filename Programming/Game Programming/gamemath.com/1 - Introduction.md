___

# Before Reading

Readers are expected to know the following basic mathematical skills:
* Algebraic expressions 代數式
* Know how to graph a function
* Very basic 2D Euclidian geometry
	* eg. what it means for lines to be parallel and perpendicular
	* some basic formulas for area and circumference
* Trigonometry 三角學
	* we will have a brief review though, but only a brief review
* Calculus
	* not necessary though
	* just give you an advantage

* Programming knowledge
	* not required
	* just so you know how to translate the ideas into code
	* C language syntax
