# DNA
* stands for *Deoxyribonucleic acid*
* carrier of genetic information in living things
* used in criminal justice for decades
	* but how does DNA profiling work?
	* how can forensic investigators[^1] identify to whom a sequence of DNA belongs?

[^1]: forensic investigator: 鑑證科
___

# format of DNA

> [!info]
> * DNA is a sequence of molecules called *nucleotides*, arranged into a particular shape, a *double helix*
> * Every human cell has billions of nucleotides arranged in sequence
> * Each nucleotide of DNA contains one of four different bases
> 	* adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T)

Some portions of the sequence, ie. *genome*[^2], are the same or at least very similar, across almost all humans
But other portions of the sequence can vary across the population

[^2]: genome: 基因組
___

# Short Tandem Repeats, STRs

An STR is a short sequence of DNA bases that tends to repeat consecutively numerous times at some locations inside of a person's DNA
* the number of times any particular STR repeats varies a lot among individuals
	* so this is one of the places where DNA tends to have high genetic diversity
* eg. `CTAGATAGATAGATAGATGACTA`
	* notice `AGAT` repeated 4 times
	* so it's a STR
___

# DNA profiling

How to tell if a pair of DNA samples come from the same person?
* usually we will look at multiple STRs to improve accuracy
	* if there is a 5% chance that any 2 people would have the same number of repeats for a single STR, and we look at 10 different STRs
	* the chance that the 2 DNA samples would match purely by chance is about 1 in 1 quadrillion
	* assuming all STRs are independent of each other
* if the 2 samples match in the number of repeats for each of the STRs, we can pretty sure that they come from the same person

> [!example]
> [CODIS](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/dna-fingerprint-act-of-2005-expungement-policy/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet), the FBI's DNA database, uses 20 different STRs as part of its DNA profiling process.

In the real world, we don't have to look through the whole DNA sequence
* analysts know on which *chromosome*[^3] and at which location in the DNA an STR will be found
* they can narrow down their search to just a section of DNA
