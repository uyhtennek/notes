A person's blood type is determined by 2 alleles, ie. different forms of a gene

There are 3 possible alleles: A, B, and O
of which each person has two, possibly the same or different

each of a child's parents randomly passes one of their 2 blood type alleles to their child
then the possible blood type combinations are OO, OA, OB, AO, AA, AB, BO, BA, and BB

eg. 1
if one parent has blood type AO and the other parent has blood type BB,
the child's possible blood types would be AB and OB

eg. 2
if one parent has blood type AO and the other OB,
the child's possible blood types would be AO, OB, AB, and OO
