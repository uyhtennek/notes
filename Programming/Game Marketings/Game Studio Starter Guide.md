# The Stair Step approach

understand what level you're at
you're not the same as Blizzard, they are much bigger than you
* you can't do all the marketing stuffs

so do small scale things first
* don't do what Blizzard does
___

# small scale advantage
do things that would be impractical for the big guys to do

you should be doing things that don't scale
* ie. personal interactions, a lot of 1-on-1 conversations
* you'd never see Blizzard or Nintendo does this, but your fans are the biggest advocates that will launch you into the next level
___

# The stair steps
if the action is not on the list, DON'T do it

eg. don't go to a conference until you release a couple games
eg. don't post on all the social networks all the time
* because you're spreading yourself too thin

## Level 0
never released a game commercially. self funded. have zero network with other indies.

* 95% effort for learning to finish a game, and then release a game
	* don't worry if nobody knows who you are
* super simple trailer
	* something like a montage of 5 second-long gameplay clips
* attend local IGDA or game dev meetups
* posting to **only** 1 Social Network
	* that you really like reading and interacting with
* a simple mailing list on the free tier like mailchimp. post once a month.
* don't worry about getting a booth at a show, don't worry about going to GDC.
* message people who have left positive reviews
	* ask their thoughs, eg. what they like, what to improve, ....
* pay a professional to design the games icon / cover art
	* the money is worth it
* interacting on your steam forums
* knowing and conversing with most folks who has purchased your game
