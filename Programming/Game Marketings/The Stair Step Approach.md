# 1. First Product

A lot of startup advice are quite hard
* eg. validating an idea, testing message-to-market match, coming up with a marketing plan, etc.
* surely it includes building the product

> [!important]
> How do you give yourself the best chance to avoiding failure?

avoid creating something too complex
* do simple product, simple marketing plan - requires a single traffic channel
* eg. avoid building a stand-alone subscription software (SaaS)

it's much easier to sell an add-on to an existing ecosystem
* eg. WordPress plugin, Shopify app, Heroku add-on

* usually small things to build;
* relatively inexpensive for customers to purchase; and
* have built in discovery through the plugin repository or app store

although smaller projects are not "sexy", they will help us become profitable much, much earlier

focus on a single traffic source
* figuring out one way of generating customers
* instead of trying to master all the different traffic channels at once

Getting those initial early sales is a big win.
* eg. ???
* start generating revenue
	* even though you're not a master marketer or any thing close yet
* let you develop new skills one-by-one as you need them

# 2. Own Your Time

we have Step 1 as our base model, now just repeat it
* until we own our time
* we may be able to grow a single product for that, or cobble a few together

once you have the first successful product and it's making a bit of money
* see if you can grow it, to that "full time income" level
* or you need to repeat the process and launch a few more products

don't abandon what already works and trying to take on a bigger challenge before you're making enough money to own all of the time in a given week

a WordPress plugins probably won't pay us enough to quit our job, but three might
* eg. Dave Rodenbaugh sell 3 premium add-ons before jumping to SaaS or trying to figure out how to promote the plugins with Facebook
* eg. Phil Derksen sold 2 WordPress plugins
* .....
