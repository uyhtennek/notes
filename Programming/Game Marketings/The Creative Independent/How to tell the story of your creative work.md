a good story is powerful
* can change the course of creative careers
	* can win audiences
	* can open opportunities
so how to harness attention?
this article hopes to help us see ourselves the way a journalist might, and write about ourselves in an entertaining way
___

# Journalism = Empathy

Good journalists think in terms of empathetic information design
* they put themselves in their readers' shoes
	* they think through what type of stories will catch their readers' attention
* they lead with a value proposition
	* why should the reader care?
	* and then gracefully guide their readers through a coherent story

so, to do this for yourself, ask questions like
* why would someone want to know about what you're doing?
* how does your story connect to wider cultural conversations that people care about?
* which elements might spark curiosity?
* what is surprising or exciting?
* what specific examples or familiar comparisons can make my point clearer?
* what needs more explanation?

Empathetic and strategic storytelling is how we build and maintain relevance
* we need to tease out the most relatable bits to craft a story around
* in each story, there is an exciting, interesting core idea that is easy to summarize
* and a lot of story threads left on the cutting room floor in order to truly focus the piece

As a creative person, you must learn to do this kind of editing as well

# Have a goal in mind
you can't think only about how to get your readers excited, it must also align with our goals

* if you want to get music readers to listen to your new album, don't tell a business-oriented story
* if you want to show that your invention is unique, don't speak in generic marketese that glosses over the technical details

eg. 1 - Goal: Keep fans engaged while working up to a bigger project launch
* maybe all you need is a steady stream of quick social posts
* or an occasional thoughtful newsletter giving some insight into your process
* so, before you dive in, plan out a consistent through-line and voice that helps explain your work
* then challenge yourself to add to it consistently
	* thinking of each post or email as one piece to the larger story you're telling

eg. 2 - Goal: Build credibility in a specific industry
* pitch an academic journal or niche publication a first-person narrative about what you've learned as you created something
* the value proposition for this type of audience is that they'll learn from your story too
* but remember the more you cater to pundits 迎合專家, the more you'll alienate 疏遠 general-audience readers

eg. 3 - Goal: Use milestone achievements to build your audience
* if you're having a high-visibility moment, like created an art installation for a well-known institution or starred in a play, journalists might approach you organically
	* but that doesn't mean they already know the depths of your story or what makes you interesting
* in fact, it's probably best to go into interviews assuming they know nothing about you
	* just to make sure you share all the important information
* prepare for the interview by thinking out a few "big ideas" or potential stories ahead of time
	* like points of dramatic tension
	* and/or how what you're doing relates to bigger-picture conversations
* even if they don't ask about those things at all, you have the power to direct the conversation or pipe up after they finish their questions to say, "and what I think is really important here is..."

eg. 4 - Goal: Make it easy for someone who stumbles across your work to understand who you are, what you're about, and what kinds of opportunities you're interested in
* take a hard look at your personal website
	* does it cover all the basic details of your creative career?
	* does it mention notable associations and achievement that could help a journalist, curator, or collaborator understand what you're about?
	* do you provide a call to action?
		* eg. "commission an illustration" instead of "my work"
* think through the web of places people might discover you, and make sure you're tailoring language to direct their interest in ways that align with your goals

# Get some ideas on paper

once you have a general idea of a storytelling angle that will be both interesting to readers and server your goals, consider which details about you and your creative practice will be relevant

Starting with the basics
* What is it that you are doing, exactly?
	* what are you making?
	* how are you making it?
	* be crystal clear
* Why does this matter?
	* why are you doing this project?
	* why would it matter to others?
	* what impact do you hope to have?
* When did you start working on this?
	* when did you first get the idea?
	* what are the dates of noteworthy milestones like investments, grants, exhibitions, ....?
	* take people through the relevant top-level timeline
* How did you do it?
	* what did you learn along the way?
	* what challenges did you overcome?
* Where did this all take place?
	* make it easy to follow your physical journey
* Who did you collaborate with?
	* List full names and add links. For good karma.

These basics probably aren't enough to fuel an exciting story, so we need to think about how we can build in dramatic tension and exciting details
* Think in terms of narrative arch
	* how can your story include a beginning, middle, and end, with some sort of character evolution or material resolution along the way?
	* there is a few formats of this that have been recycled for hundred of years:
		* a stranger comes to town (disrupting old ways of being 擾亂現狀), a man or woman goes on a journey (discovering something new)
		* or David and Goliath (an underdog challenges established power).
* Consider the comparisons, examples, and explanations that can make the story more relatable and compelling to readers who don't yet know you
	* are you associated with collaborators or institutions that might have more name-brand recognition than you alone?
	* are there wider cultural conversations your work is part of?
	* Trends it's rejecting or changing?
	* Are there comparisons that can link your work to more familiar concepts?
		* eg. tech articles often describe services as "the Uber of \_\_\_"
* Generalities are boring, so get into the details
	* as you start to tell your story, strive to really take people back to the scene
		* what you were thinking about?
		* what you were doing at the time?
		* this is what people mean with this age-old writing tip, "show don't tell"
	* if you're an entrepreneur, don't just say you tested different ideas until one stuck
	* if you're an artist, don't just say you kept working on the album until it sounded right
	* Give relevant, on-topic details

> [!quote] eg. Mark Tribe talked about his landscape film
> I found myself out in the woods with a bunch of mostly young men in camouflage with AR-15s and AK-47s firing thousands of live rounds into the trees, I became really curious about the role that landscape played, in that those training exercises where people are preparing and rehearsing for Armageddon, they choose to do it in these incredibly beautiful spots. Partly for practical reasons, but partly because I think landscape, in our imagination, is a kind of tabula rasa, a blank slate onto which we project all kinds of fantasies.

* Check that you're being really honest.
	* the most frustrating interviews would be trying to sound as business as to be in Forbes or more community-centric to be in Kickstarter Magazine
	* no you don't mold your story to fit somebody else's expectations
		* it does everyone a disservice
	* the end result won't be convincing, and people won't really get to know you
	* just be honest, tell your true story, don't fake it
* If you're stuck, try interviewing yourself, or asking a friend to
	* record audio on your computer, and get a transcript of it
		* you can use Temi for this
		* or you can just type it out yourself
	* Reading over a transcript can help the best bits of your story jump out
	* it gives you some raw material to refine
		* so that you don't have to start at a blank page

> [!tip] Potentially interesting interview questions
> * Why did you start this project or get into this type of work?
> * What's been the most challenging or surprising part of your creative journey?
> * What were the most significant evolutions along the way?
> * How does [your project or company] relate to [a much larger cultural trend]? What can this project say about that trend?
