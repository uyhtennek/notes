# Hooks

> [!quote] A good game isn't good enough.
> Despite everyone giving them positive feedback and reviews, the game only sold a few hundred copies.

Games don't have big hooks, can't work
* 95% of indie games, don't make a profit

> [!quote]
> If you are not confident in being able to explain why the hits hit and why others did not, **you shouldn't be confident about your game's chances either.**

so why the hits hit?
they need to sit in the overlap of:
1. something that you want to make
	* something that you would still enjoy to make, even after working on it for a year or more
2. something that you are able to make
	* you need to be skilled at estimating scope
	* you need to be skilled at estimating budget and the abilities of your team
3. something that you're confident that will make money

how do you tell if a game sit in that overlap?
you can evaluate:
1. the quantity and quality of the game hooks
2. the viability of the market for similar games
3. how you can describe and promote the game

Hook is the entry
* preferably multiple hooks
* so that people will talk about and press will write about your game

game hooks take effect before the game is even played
* because it compels people to try the game or discuss it
___

## eg. Crypt of the Necrodancer
this game provides a few hooks

1. the name is a pun
* it's not much, but at the very least, the name is memorable

2. its core mechanic is a hook
* it's a roguelike rhythm game
* already this sounds interesting

3. it has an excellent hooky soundtrack
* written by a well known composer
* so there is this star power
	* and that's why celebrity endorsements in advertising actually work
* so people on your team, can be hooks

4. it has memorable characters and enemies
* eg. the fan favorite is a singing shopkeeper
* eg. there is a dancing skeletons, full of personality
* that gets people talking

5. the game can be played with a dance pad
* it's unusual so the dance pads at their booths always drew large crowds
* then large crowds drew attention of any members of the press who might have been walking by

6. the game has good catchy trailers

surely, not all hooks are equal
the most powerful ones here may be the game's core mechanic and the excellent music
* but, the more hooks you have, the more compelling each hook is
* so the greater your chance of snagging someone's interest

so, it makes sense to wait for the design that stands out belong as many axes as possible
* ideally you want every facet of your project to be unique and compelling
* eg. the gameplay, the art, the audio, the name, the story, the dev team, ....., everything

> [!tip] make it an habit
> you need to become adept at evaluating hooks
> you can practice by examining the hooks of other successful and unsuccessful indie games

___

## eg. Darkest Dungeon

1. it's designed for offering the experience of being in a terrifying dungeon
* everyone would be immediately agree that this is the first true dungeon crawler
	* because everyone agrees that a dungeon would be terrifying if it was real
* this concept alone, is a massive hook

2. art style is some seriously masterful work
* and perfectly suited to the game theme
* and perfectly suited to Steam audience

3. the game has a narrator, and his voice is astoundingly good
* his name is Wayne June
* they found him because he was narrating HP Lovecraft audiobooks

4. the game soundtrack was created by an actual rock star
* name was Stuart Chatwood
	* his band was well-known in North America in the 90s
* again, star power

5. hooky and compelling trailers

fun fact:
1. back when the two founders, Tyler and Chris, not yet launched the game, they were not sure how well it was going to do
2. Ryan, happens to be a friend of them, told them it would double Necrodancer's sales results
3. He was right
	* at least on SteamSpy

> [!tip] again, practice estimating hooks
> 1. guess the numbers before games launch, by looking at their hooks
> 2. look at their sales results afterwards
> 3. repeat, to develop a feel for it

___

## eg. Influencers

YouTubers and streamers keep making video after video, and putting tons of effort into their production quality, despite the fact that they've had consistently low viewer count

their videos actually have good quality and similar to their more successful peers in many ways
* but they lack that spark
* they just aren't unique enough

they probably overestimating the entertainment value of their work,
and don't understand the non-luck factors that generate success for others
* they can't accurately compare themselves to the big shots
* so they don't know what they are lacking

actually, it's kinda like the cases for many indie game dev
___

# Market Analysis
it can be fun. at least you get to play games.

1. find the 10 or 20 games that you think are closest design wise to your game
* you may find it difficult to find similar games, but still, find the closest games

2. play all of them, examine their hooks, and look at their sales results
* importantly, do include games that have sold poorly

3. try to come up with explanations for why this game works but that game doesn't
* contrast the top sellers to the rest
* so that you get to see the common factors and the differences
___

## Trends
market analysis is all about trends

is the market for a certain type of game, trending up? down? or steady?
* how big is the market?
* how competitive is the market?
* what are the reasons for the underlying trend?

knowing how strong is a given market is now, is helpful
but only if you understand the trend, you can predict how strong that market might be, when your game finally launches
* which could be a year or two later down the road

how you can learn the trends?
* you want to keep a close eye on the Steam top sellers charts
	* as well as the list of new releases
* so that you can develop a sense for both
	* the types of games that are selling well
	* and the types of games that are selling poorly
* you watch the charts long enough, you begin to identify trends

eg. game X and game Y are quite similar
* game Y came out two years ago
* game X seems to be of higher quality
* but it turns out game X is selling significantly worse
* then, perhaps the genre is falling out of favor
	* if you then see all games in that genre are selling more poorly than predecessors, you've likely identified a change in trend

> [!important] Stay on top of trend.
> You don't want to develop a game that falls in an unfavored genre. It can be costly. And you can look at the best-sellers in the genre, to learn what design makes you stand in a better position in the market.
> 
> eg. Arcade Twin Stick Shooter performs poorly in 2013-2016. However, Rougelike Twin Stick Shooter like The Binding of Issac and Enter The Gungeon, does perform very well. There if you decided to make Twin Stick Shooter in around that period of time, you might avoid a costly mistake.

and for that, you need to understand the factors that support a trend
___

## eg. Survival Sim games
Survival Sim has been around for quite some time, but why?

1. it's human natural, to hunt and gather resources and survive, but modern lifestyle took it away
* as a result, we found strong feelings from Survival Sim that other genres cannot deliver

2. the genre is fairly flexible, and can support many aesthetics
* eg. 2D, 3D, first-person, third-person, god view, ....
* so plenty of room for innovation and new types of games

3. Survival games tend to have high retention
* the trend on Steam is towards games with high retention

4. work well with online multiplayer
* which is another trend on the rise

5. very streamable, great for content creators
* which is another trend on the rise

in fact, most of the original survival games of this era still sell well
* some of them still are the top selling games on Steam in recent years
___

## eg. Puzzle Adventure games

in contrast, puzzle adventure games seem to be on the decline
* probably because this genre is on the opposite side of many of these sub-trends

1. low replayability, and low retention
2. mostly not multiplayer
3. not favored by streamers and YouTubers
	* because getting stumped doesn't make entertaining viewing
___

## Market Size
you should take a look at the size and composition of any market that you're interested in

* are there enough fans of this type of game to generate the sales results you need?
	* to survive?
* has even the highest-grossing game produced enough revenue?
	* if not, you may be in trouble
	* unless you get lucky and be the first to popularize the genre or to discover a new genre
		* this is actually the case for Minecraft
		* but if you do rely on that to happen, can you survive if that doesn't happen?

also, broad or vague charts or vague analysis can't give useful insights
instead you want to analyze only the handful of games that are most similar to your design
* in other words, game genres doesn't mean much because they tend to be vague
	* both Action FPS and Action Roguelike fall into the Action genre, but people may enjoy Action Roguelike but hate Action FPS
* so, sub-genres are important
	* or more specifically, the designs are important
___

## Competition
take a look at the type of competition you're up against

eg. sure the MOBA market is gigantic, but how you plan to steal players from League of Legends and DOTA?
* those games retain their players for years on end
* unless you can offer an experience that is so much better than both of them, that people are willing to abandon their LOL or DOTA friends and ranks to get it, you can't defeat them
* can you do that? maybe, but it'd be an uphill battle for sure.

eg. by contrast, there are a variety of indie genre where individual games are played for 5 to 20 hours, and then players move on
* if you can give them a unique new experience, maybe some players would move on to your game next

so the big idea here is that,
it's dangerous to enter a market where gamers are monogamous with their game of choice
it's safer to woo those polyamorous gamers who love numerous games
as a result, if a market is large and contains polyamorous gamers, your game may be profitable, even with weaker hooks
if a market is small and contains monogamous gamers, then your game better have some astoundingly delicious hooks
___

# New Genre
how do we estimate the potential of a game whose type is fairly new?

eg. Crypt of the Necrodancer
* which has a genre of Rhythm + Roguelike

well, you estimate both markets
* and you attempt to guess how much they overlap
* because the overlap is your actual target market
	* because only the players who love both genre would love your game
	* if a player love Rhythm but hate Roguelike, then they hate your game

therefore, you will have an easier time reaching some minimum level of sales, but the max audience size is limited
* simply due to that one factor
* in fact, that's the reason why Ryan is confident about Necrodancer would be profitable, but don't know if it can turn out to be a hit

but, Darkest Dungeon doesn't have this problem of genre confusion
* because it's a totally new experience, instead of this mix-and-match experience
* that gives it a much wider target audience
___

# Guessing game
how to guess games' revenue?

1. Check for owners
* how many people bought the game?
* typically via steamspy

2. multiply that by the game's retail price

3. take bundles into account
* so lower the number that we got by some amount
* Google probably can tell you whether or not a game has been in any bundles

4. take steep sales / discounts / steam free weekends into account
* steamdb.info can tell us how deeply a game has been discounted

5. others like platform holder fees, taxes like VAT, estimated budget, and rev shares
* many money lost here

> [!tip] steamspy
> if a game's steamspy stats of owner is significantly higher than its stats for player, it indicates that a pay what you want bundle or some other kind of giveaway has probably taken place.

___

# Moonshots
if you try to make a mega-hit like Minecraft

generally you need a whole new genre, or take an existing nice genre and bring it mainstream
* basically, you need to have a perfect sense of the current gaming zeitgeist 時代 / 精神時代
* and then identify the largest hole in the zeitgeist
* and produce a game that flawlessly and fully fills that hole
* like Minecraft did, easy.

but that zeitgeist can shift
* the hole can be transient 短暫
* eg. if some other big fad game had come out just prior to Flappy Bird, would it becomes as big of a hit as it was?
* so the timing is key

the hole in the zeitgeist that exists now,
two years later, the hole is probably different already, if it even was still there

Flappy Bird is a big hit, because it was one of the first for a long while
* people are starved for that type of game
* once it start spreading, it's hard to stop because it's brand new to the majority
* the game itself doesn't offer that much, but its timing is wonderful
	* although that timing is transient

By contrast, the market never have a game like Minecraft
* Minecraft can show up any time and harvest the hole, its timing doesn't matter much
* some years later, nobody will talk about Flappy Bird but people are still playing Minecraft
	* because Minecraft still is unique in the market

so what is the hole that Minecraft harvest?
one of them probably is that we haven't discover that children function quite different as we would thought
* turns out sandbox and survival and voxel and multiplayer are somehow things that children, and probably their parent as well, favor a lot

> [!tip] what game to make next?
> To make the most out of your production, maybe you should try to feel the zeitgeist. It's unlikely that you would make a mega-hit, but who knows. Just remember to balance your risk.
> 
> In addition, think about things that have hit recently and think about why it happens and what it means for the state of the market, is a useful practice.
> 
> As we need to play the guessing game any way, by releasing our game some years later rather than present, why not try making the best bet?

___

# Promotion
it should happen right back when you start designing the game

coming up promotions, and designing games, are kinda similar
* if you can design a game that people would enjoy
* then you can design a promotions that people would enjoy
	* or design a game that promotes itself
* then you have an easier time trying to make people buy your game

assuming you now already have a hooky game
* you need to plan how to communicate those hooks effectively
	* via trailers, store page text blurbs, etc.
* if the game doesn't translate well to trailers and text descriptions, you will be relying on people playing the game, experiencing the hooks, and then spreading awareness of the game via their own enthusiasm
	* then if they can't translate your game well, others just wouldn't get it, so wouldn't try as well

although some hits, even the biggest hits like Minecraft, spread primarily through word-of-mouth
* you may want to have a different promotional strategy
* because you are not Minecraft or you don't have Minecraft level of virality
___

## Testing hooks

if you are unsure of the strengths of your games hooks, you should test them
* eg. putting out a early teaser trailer
* eg. demoing at PAX

if it can gathered quite a few views, and even was covered fairly widely by the press, it could give you a lot of confidence so you're more comfortable to spending more on the game

be caution what the fans or friends actually say though
* no matter how good or bad the game is, they would likely say, "I had fun!", and then they will give the controller back to you
* so instead, you should pay attention to what they actually do
	* because body language is more honest
___

## quote from authority
festival awards and words from press, are important

sure, they by themselves don't drive mountains of sales
* but people need to hear about your game from numerous sources, before they'll actually watch the trailer, or buy the game
* so accolades and review quotes are very helpful
	* when people open up your store page or your trailers, you throw them this some amount of good words about your game
	* even they still have doubt, they probably would think, "if it has all these awards and great reviews, I guess I should watch the whole trailer."
* then you can continue selling your hooks
___

## be human

what makes a noteworthy story? a human angle.
* a headline of "our game has launched" is not very exciting
	* so what? thousands of games launched every year.
* so try to come up with something more personal and compelling
	* also we are indeed, and providing a human angle is one thing that we can but AAA can't
	* the press are talking directly to us, the creators

....
