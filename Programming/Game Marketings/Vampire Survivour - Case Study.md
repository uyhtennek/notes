# Toge Productions's story

Toge Productions
* indie game development and publishing studio
* from Indonesia
* started with 2 guys with no money and no experience


## 1. Start Small

they started by making small flash games
try creating and releasing 3-4 small projects first before doing a commercial project
* so before resigning from the day job and before risking your entire life


## 2. Reuse & Recycle

a common practice
* make the next project more accessible


## 3. Fail Fast, Fail Forward

avoid over-scoping
more time ≠ will success
* 99.9% of early projects fail, millions revenue first try are outliers

fail first try stories
* super ambitious, but fatally flawed plan
* due to inexperience, the game fails
* put more time and money trying to fix the game
* also fail, then add more, hoping that can save it, and then fail, ....
	* trapped in *sunk cost fallacy*
* finally released the game
	* disappointing results
* can't recover from it

*Fail fast* is one of the lean startup methodology
* recognize failure as early as possible and avoid sunk cost fallacy
* *Fail Forward* just means learn from the fails and move forward

So, do quick iterations, and learn from the mistakes


## 4. Know Your Audience

*the pottery class parable*
* just a fancy way of saying practice makes perfect
* the best way to learn: the mode you do, the more you know, the better you get

However, you might get lost and confused if you don't know who the target audience is
* one of Coffee Talk's successes is that they have a relatively good picture of who the audience is, their persona, what hooks them, and the experience they are looking for in a game
* knowing who you are making your game for, gives you direction
	* then you know what you should avoid, and why you should do things a certain way


## 5. Know Your Limits

"How hard can it be?", is usually a bad sign
* even the most experienced developers can still fall victim
* Coffee Talk almost kill them
	* thought development time is 6 months, turns out shipped the game 2 years later
	* nearly run out of money
* they never made a narrative game before
	* underestimated the writing process
	* thought "how hard can writing dialogues be?"

climbing Mount Everest needs
* preparations, planning, practice, .....
* also need to know your limits
	* what's possible
	* what's not possible
	* the risks


## 6. Milestones → Steppingstones

milestones is not a new concept
But, we can turn each milestone into its own game

they have a game, Infectonator
which is a big zombie apocalypse simulation game, with procedural geomap, ....
so the milestones were:
* AI pathfinding & behavior system
* Validate core game loop
* Procedural maps
* Resource management
* Scaling up the game

so one game becomes 8-10 games
* more experience, and more know-how
* more fans, and more awareness
* more revenue
* even can create "spin-offs" games
	* reusing the code and assets

the same mindsets applied when they jumped into 3D


## 7. Be Nice, Make Friends
Don't go alone.

To survive, you'll need great people around you, and hopefully, partners
although finding them will not be easy

learn from others
find mentors
often times gain mental support

# Vampire Survivors's Success

its genre is kinda new, *Hyper-hardcore*
* as opposed to *Hyper-casual*

* Simplistic arcade-style core gameplay loop
* Not much or none tutorialization
* No story
* VERY addicting gameplay
* meta-progression mechanism
	* steeped in rogue-lite sensibility
	* eg. runs, upgrades, randomness, randomized buffs, high difficulty, permadeath
* Simplistic 2D pixel art graphics
* CHEAP price
* Top notch quality and game feel
* Lots of achievements


## Cheap but high quality

eg. Ryanair
* a discount airline in Europe
* cheap, but safe and on-time

ONLY gameplay. ALL fun.
* art is minimal, no story
* REALLY good game feel, REALLY fun, REALLY deep

Great support
* no fatal bugs or no bugs at all
* frequent update
	* new patches, new contents
	* even back when there was only 10 views on itch.io
* ng. sokpop never patch their games
	* got many bad reviews

Price is cheap enough
* that people just go "yeah, let's just buy it. it costs only $3."
* but not wishlist and wait for a sale and forgot about it
* once an audience gets the hype. the game is sold.

> [!tip]
> We don't have to make something as deep in one go. We can break the game to smaller games and then combine them together one day.


## Streamers are hungry
they are tired of $10-$30 games

> [!quote] Splattercat
> This is a cool title that surprised me, I don't get surprised a ton anymore, you churn through a lot of games every year but the magic gets old quick.... But at the end of the day \[Vampire Survivors] corners the point of a video game which is to be fun and provide escapism...

so there really is a hole in the market for cheap but fast-paced arcade-games on Steam
* In the 80s and 90s, it was coin-op arcade games
* In the 2000s, it was flash games
* In the 2010s, $1-$3 games are dominated by F2P and hyper casual games
* it's hard to find cheap really quick dose adrenaline-inducing games

it is safe to make deep games in the $15-$40 price range with popular genres
but it is also good to occasionally produce arcade-style games like Vampire Survivors
* if you are available, like if you have a gap in your release schedule, or you have some people on your team in-between projects
* But don't churn out a cheap, low quality game
