# Common mistakes


## No cover image

If you don't know how to make good cover art
* take a picture of your game, at any thing interesting in your game
	* one quick-and-dirty trick is to turn off your in-game UI and take a screenshot
* scale and crop it 640 x 512
* upload, done


## Boring game page

**Add screenshoots**
* no one like words
* no matter it's one sentence or 1,000 words of lore
* also pretty up your game description

Some content suggestions
* about your game
* how to play
* team members and their roles
* call for actions, feedbacks, ....
* tools and assets you used


## High barrier to entry

people need easy access to your game
* [find a hosting service](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/hosting-guide)
* WebGL > other platforms
	* target WebGL from the get go, and build from time to time, to avoid last-minute snags

if you're using *itch.io*, change your pricing to *"No payments"*
* so it doesn't prompt users to pay


## Broken build

make sure your game runs
* **download your own game** and test
* try on another machine if you can
	* or at least a different browser
* resize the window, change aspect ratio, ....., break your game
	* before your players do

if you're using Unity, a common issue is that forgetting to upload the supporting files and only sharing the exe. It needs the *entire* output directory.


## Ludum Dare
common things about LD's website

You can change your game description at any time, but
1. You need to redo the submission checklist every time you update
2. You need to click "Save", and then "Done"

so you can change the page after the submission deadline
* even fix bugs
	* they allow bug fix releases *only*
	* some people agree, some don't, do what you like
* extending the game, adding new features, are not appreciated
* you should spell out changes

# Getting noticed
now the marketing part begins


## Play and rate other games

There is a thing called the *"Zero" filter*
* it gives great visibility to games that haven't been rated yet
* but once you have at least one rating, you'll lose that

Preferably play games from the None and Danger categories
* play and rate a bunch, then your game will show up higher in the Classic filter
* Smart and Feedback filters, on the other hand, demand you to leave insightful feedbacks

Rate is valuable than leaving comments though
* Rate > leavn many short comments > leave paragraphs of insightful feedbacks
* yes it is unbalanced


## Blog

write a blog post, show up on the front page
* advertise your game with a pretty gif
* slip a link to your game somewhere in the middle

some people even just don't do ratings, instead just blogspamming
* it's not moral, but it works
* if you want to be respectful, write something valuable

Suggestions to blog content
* advertise your game
* offer some insight into your development process
* even something unrelated to your game

* the key point being you get people to rate your game some how


## Twitch (and YouTube?)

Find people who are streaming Ludum Dare games
* this take more effort though, you can't just drop your game and disappear


## Social media

Post about your games
* use hash-tags! 


## Promotion on your hosting site

basically, just make your game looks good on the site

# My After thoughts
not from the guide

game needs to be great
* it's very content-driven, best marketing strategy is great cover art, great game page with screenshots, profound history of game development
* packaging is everything
	* marketing tricks come after
	* blog posts boost views a bit, but not that much of a great trick
		* do be ware of your timing, if you do blog posts!

* rate and give a lot of feedbacks are not the answer
	* it can get you enough ratings eventually, if you do many
	* but many people just don't play the game if they see it bad, and not rate as well
	* many great jammers just don't rate others, get many rates any way

* streamers expect decent games, it's not an ideal move to throw what ever you have to them
	* although ,if you watch the streams, you get to see many great games from small teams
	* many people throw their games to them because they're confident

actually i guess doing marketing things, rating, giving feedbacks, can only be done really for fun....
* so ineffective (at least it's the case for me this time)

people are so polite, perhaps too polite
* basically, no one would say bad words
	* or bad words are delivered in a really weak way
	* you have to know to scale bad reviews 10x to be more neutral
		* otherwise you would just mistakenly think you did a great job
		* if people are saying any bad words, you're not doing a great job
* still, feedbacks are valuable, any feedback at all, is valuable
	* although it would be more valuable to have bad feedbacks
	* i guess you have to demand people to leave bad reviews
		* especially when you're thinking you did well


## Conclusion

Game jams are valuable. You can learn a lot from people.

Do make sure your game is great! You probably need to put every effort on it. Otherwise you can only get much less value out of the jam.
* Come up with good game idea if you get to know the themes beforehand.
* Think of your ideas' marketability.
	* Do they look cool in a GIF?
	* Do they produce many interesting screenshots?
* Generally it's better to let player get to the fun part quickly.
	* great games are fun after fun after fun after fun any way

Rating, leaving feedbacks, playing others games, are not valuable for your game.
* although it's valuable for the community, so it's moral to do some but not none at all
	* just that it's meaningless to put much time and effort on it
* it's valuable to your growth though because you get to learn many from people
	* definitely can benefit from playing some masters' games
	* so follow people who produced good games and who have a profound game development history

Game Jam is a great place to get to know some very brilliant game devs.
