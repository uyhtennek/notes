___

# Resume

> [!quote]
> Resume is not important!
> People spend less than 30 seconds to read your resume.

## DOs

1. One page, no exception
* even very great people make one page resume

2. Easy to skim
* well-formatted
* easy to get the key details

3. Obvious contact info
* imagine a manager want to interview or hire you now, but can't find how to contact you

4. Highlight specific accomplishments
* eg. Improve some system by 5%, increase revenue by 3%, etc.

5. Include interesting personal projects
* what you build?


## DON'Ts

1. No charts or ratings
* you don't know your skill level ratings, neither do others
* it's wasting space

2. No objective
* waste space
* everyone's objectives are just the same

3. Use a professional email

4. Include relevant links
* LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio

5. Aesthestic doesn't matter
* people generally don't care about the design
* as long as it's easy to skim
___

# Before Interview


## Timing

* Interview early
* Plan interviewing into your schedule

* Look for opportunities geared at your experience
	* eg. Google's, Microsoft's internships for first-year students or folks with no experience
	* Try to apply those first if you're in that category
	* free opportunities


## Process

* Online coding challenge
* Take home assignment
* Technical phone screen
	* a manager asks you technical questions in phone
* Onsite


## Types of Interviews

* Algorithms & Coding
* System Design
* Practical
* Deep Dive
* Values
___

# Expectations of You
what people expect of you

* think through a problem
* write actual functional code
* fix issues along the way

* reason about runtime

* Communicate clearly!!!
	* to the interviewer
___

# How to prepare an interview


## Know the basics

* Practice decreases stress

* Pick a language and stick to it
	* very rare people ask you to fix issue in a specific language
	* the worst thing is the first thing to think about during interview is, what language should I use to solve this problem.
		* you should know that before the question

* Learn syntax, builtins, errors
	* you're very comfortable with the language
	* you don't need to think about the syntax, how to do something, how to read errors, etc.
	* all your brain cells go to solving the problem but not anything else

* create a function
* define a class
* work with strings
* work with lists
* work with trees


## Interview problems
* usually aren't complex at all
	* answer always is a simple one

* eg. what's the runtime of something?
	* Constant
	* Logarithmic
	* Linear
	* Polynomial
	* Exponential
		* if the answer is exponential then probably the interview is far from done though


## Toolbox of Concepts
* interview questions fundamentally are some basic CS concepts

**Concepts**
* Recursion, Divide-and-Conquer
* Graph Searches
* Greedy Algorithms
* Strings
* Searching & Sorting
* Dynamic Programming

**Tools**
* Arrays, linked lists
* Hash tables
* Binary search
* Shortest-path algorithms
* Memoization


## Simulate the environment

* people sometimes look at a problem, have "some ideas" about how to solve, and flip to the answer page immediately and goes "Yeah I totally had it"
	* but in reality, they didn't
* So write our the solution yourself, don't look at the answer

* Also time yourself, since time limit is a real thing in interview
* if an interview doesn't allow you to use Google, simulate that

* Look for patterns in your own performance
	* See what you're good at and not good at
	* Zone in on the areas where you're not

* Practice with friends
	* less lonely
	* but it's good because it can simulate the real environment

> [!tips]
> When you attend an interview, you want to feel like "I've done this before". So the situation is not weird and new to you. And the only possible way is that you take the time and simulate the environment beforehand.

___

# During the interview

* interviewers care about process than output

* it's usual that people didn't get the correct answer, their code didn't work, didn't think of the edge cases
	* but they still made it through the next round
* because their thought process was really clear
* able to articulate the trade-offs of their approach
* Then interviewers can be confident in thinking that, maybe if they had a couple more minutes or a little bit less stress, they could have gotten the answer correct.

* so during the interview, don't focus on did I get the right answer
* focus on the process for getting that answer


## Icebreaker
* take a deep breath, center yourself, before it starts
* have an intro prepared
	* but just a quick one
	* shouldn't be your focus
* be ready to talk about a project
	* pick a project that you can talk about for 5-10 minutes
	* what the challenges? what went well? what didn't?
* don't ramble
	* when people are nervous, they tend to keep talking
	* be mindful of that
	* you should stop and pause to let your interviewer interject and ask questions


## Approaching Technical Problems

* Don't panic!
* if you have seen the same problem, tell your interviewer
	* no good in pretending you're a gineous
	* people know you're cheating

* ask clarifying questions
	* ask something like "so let me just confirm, with this input, the output should be this"
	* then the interviewer is like "yep, that's right"
* Then now you kinda concluded to yourself, you understand the constraints of this problem
	* rather than jumping in and assuming it's something
	* and no one could've tell you're on the wrong track
		* otherwise you burn 20 minutes solving the wrong things
* So Confirm you have a full understanding of the problem
	* a great tactic is, "here's an input, is this the correct output?"

* it's weird but it's good to speak out your thought process out loud
	* don't do, "okay thanks for the problem, see you in 20, I'll shoot you over solution"
	* do constantly vocalizing your though process
* like,
	* first I'm going to create a function, let's call it find minimum
	* we need one argument here, it's a list
	* so the first thing to do with the list is loop it
	* .....
* This is the best way to communicate your though process to the interviewer

* try to think through multiple possible approaches
	* you probably would come up with some or many solutions
	* some are efficient, some are not
* talk out loud what you're thinking, why you choose this approach, before you type any character
	* explain the possible solutions to your interviewer, get on the same page so you're aligned
* So you're roughly on the right track here

* if it's helpful, draw a diagram
	* whiteboard, pen and paper, etc.
	* you're allow to visualize the problem, so if it helps, draw it


## Pattern-match your knowledge

* Can we formulate this as a graph?
* Can we formulate this recursively?
* Can we use a binary search?
* Can we decompose and memoize sub-problems?

There is a very very very very high probability that, the concepts and tools you already know apply
* what's gonna make the most sense for the problem


## Common mistakes

* people think of the problem very specifically, rather than generally
	* start with high level ideas

* if your solution seems too complicated, it probably is
	* usually interview questions are designed to be solved in just few lines of code
	* so they're really using the right concepts
* if you have this crazy complex ideas, check with your interviewer
	* does this seem like it's on the right track? or there's a simpler way that I could approach this

* don't be afraid to ask for help, if you're really stuck
	* certainly don't ask every 3 minutes
	* but if you do hit a wall, be honest about that
* funny enough, interviewer does want to help you
	* it's really not fun to watch you get stuck for an hour
	* so we don't want that, interviewer also don't
* so give opportunity to the interviewer to jump in to help you

* again, explain your solution, before touching your keyboard
	* align on high level idea, before getting in low level details
* many interviewers won't stop you if you start writing code
	* maybe you get it, maybe not, but no body want to read your code
	* they just don't want to get in your way and mess you up
* so make sure you're on the same page before coding

> [!important]
> Process, not output

how you approach a problem, and how you help yourself solving a problem,
is far more important than you getting the right answer and precise runtime


## Strategy

* folks will try to jump right in to the most optimal solution to a problem, before they can get something working at all
	* it's better to leave an interview, with garbage codes
	* than garbage codes that don't work
* after the code works, then you start optimizing it, simplifying it

* when interviewer does jump in and say something like "have we considered using a list for this"
	* the answer to that is never no
	* many do somehow say no, as they don't know it was a hint
* don't get really zoomed in on your approach, your code
* it's a conversation in an interview, so communicate


## Coding

* your goal is to write a function that returns the answer
	* unless you're told otherwise
* first line of code isn't `int main(int argc, char* argv[])`
	* it should be a definition of a function, which takes a or some inputs and returns something

* decompose functionalities as needed
	* again, it gets something working
	* also, if you observe that it'd be easier to solve the problem with some helper functions
		* feel free to tangent, write those functions, and then come back

* use reasonable and readable variable names and function names
* if you can, factor our common logic
	* write well-designed code
	* but still, the primary goal is to get something working, clean code is secondary


## Testing Code without Running
some interview doesn't allow running code

* be the computer
	* run through your code line by line
		* write down the state of variables
		* walk through the branches
		* how many times you'll go through a loop
	* as if you're a debugger or CPU
		* say out loud what's going to happen
* the outcome is either,
	* you're doing the right thing, as your code is right, you gain confidence
	* you find bugs
		* and maybe you can find bugs before the interviewer this way


## Testing Code with Running

* it's highly advised to run the code

* write test cases
	* maybe you and your interviewer agreed on cases at the start of the interview
	* actually encode those, in the bottom of your file
	* then run the code to see if they pass

* don't just randomly guess and check
	* at least don't do it in an interview
	* reason through the changes you're making, convince yourself and interviewer that your changes are helpful to solve the problem correctly

* print and debug relevant state
	* if something's not working, don't just stare at it and think
	* print out different variables
* That's how you spot bugs

* don't dropping down to some debugger or use Valgrind or something
	* you just don't have time
	* printing is faster
* again, process, not output
	* writting perfect bug free code is good
	* but how you fix bugs is important too
___

# System Design Interview

In this type of interview, you're not gonna be writing a bunch of code, but instead you're gonna architecting some larger system.

so just the basic tools are not enough here, we need some building blocks
* databases?
* caching?
* message queues?
* services?
* which parts are online, which are offline?

what you need to do is essentially
* piece together the building blocks
* draw some visuals may help

* think through the requirements of your system
	* eg. scalability
	* ask the interview, is this going to support 10 users or a thousand users, a million users
		* since the system architect is going to vary
___

# Practical Interview
2 shapes

## given a codebase
* maybe a GitHub project, your job is to make some change to it
	* it can get scary, since you need to read others 500 lines of code
* in this case you want to search for concepts
	* eg. you want to change the home feed, then search for `feed`
* also stack traces are your friend
	* when you're looking at some code base, at some point you're in some function, but don't knwo what is calling this function
	* then just go divide by zero inside of that function
		* then it will crash your program
		* but it gives you a stack traces to see how you get there
* very useful when start getting a grasp of a new code base quickly
	* which is the goal of these question
	* to learn this huge thing in jsut 45 minutes or so

## not given a codebase
* typically take-home interview
	* eg. build an app, write a script to scrape this website, represent something
* for these, focus on code quality with your solution
	* people are less concerned about did you do it the right way
	* but more about the design of your code
* What would you actually push to production?
	* if the answer is no, take some time to fix it up
___

# Deep Dive Interview
your job is to present some interesting past project

* people is looking for you to know the details in and out
	* if you built some system, you should be able to tell how everything works
	* otherwise people doubt if you knew what you were doing, or that you actually built this
	* so you should know the lower level stuff in and out

* also people are interested in your trade-offs and thought process
	* aside from the system and design you already built
	* what else did you consider? what designs you end up not going with? what was your thought process? were you making trade-offs, maybe it's speed or usability or else?
* so discuss all things you thought about, on the way to arriving to your final solution
	* not just the final solution itself

* highlight the challenges
	* what parts are really non-obvious, non-intuitive, the hardest things for you to build?
	* interviewers are interested in those
* what is the hardest thing you did? what's the thing you're most proud of?
	* then you should highlight that
____

# Values Interview
totally non-technical interview

so maybe it's someone a manager who is interviewing you
* not necessarily someone on the engineering team

* talk about your past expreience, the collaboration, prioritizing projects, working with others, etc.
	* all the stuff around writing code

**2 parts**
* first past is you looking back on your past experience, past internships
	* what did you learn? what are you proud of? what was really hard for you? how did you work with others?
	* so look back and just start reflecting on those past experiences
	* so that you'll be able to talk about them
* the other half is looking forward
	* why are you interested in this internship? what are you looking for in your next role? what skills or languages you want to learn?
	* what are your 6-12 months goals? what are your 3-5 years goals?

it's kinda crazy. but it's what interviewers interested in.
* what are your goals and aspirations?
* if you go "I don't know...",
	* interviewers would be worried that you don't have that growth mindset and sort of that appetite for learning

so the best way to be ready for this is just
* think about these in advance
* do some reflection and introspection on your own

typically interviewers would ask "tell me about a time you something something"
* basically asking you to pull stories out
___

# Reverse Interview

> [!quote]
> Not only the comapny is interviewing you. You're also interviewing the company.

* Have questions ready in advance
	* What does the day-to-day life look like at your role?
	* What's your team culture?
	* What they like about the team, what they would want to change?
	* What they are proud of? What their growth path has looked like?
	* What are the big problems that your team is solving? What are you really trying to solve at a higher level?
	* What've you learned recently, your experience, your growings?

* Don't ask questions that are googleable...
	* eg. how many employees? what year is your company founded?

* Great for us to get a sense of what it's actually like to work at this company
* Great for interviewer to share a bit more about their experience
	* which is gonna be valuable
___

# Don't Worry
don't worry about interview

* interviews are high-variance
* everyone bombs interviews
* they are not fun
* each interview is an opportunity to get better

> [!quote]
> Don't be sorry. Be better.

___

# Takeaways

* Have the basics down
* Build your toolbox
* Do lots of realistic practice problems
* Communicate a solution before writing code
