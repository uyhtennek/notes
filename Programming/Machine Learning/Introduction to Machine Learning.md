# What is ML?

It's about taking a lot of data, and having the computer, or an algorithm, or a program, process the important parts of that data
* recognize the patterns in the data
* then attempt to generalize to a bigger data set
* 3 categories

1. Supervised learning
* given some **labeled** data, how can machines learn to predict labels of an unseen data
* eg. give a machine a bunch of cat and dog and random photos and make it guess does this photo contains a cat or a dog

2. Unsupervised learning
* given some **unlabeled** data, how can machines learn to find useful patterns from the data

3. Reinforcement learning
* given some game rules, how can machines learn what is the best move
	* simply by playing the game a bunch of times
