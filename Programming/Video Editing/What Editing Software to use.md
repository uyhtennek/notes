[What Editing Software should I use?](https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/10qr2fc/february_what_editing_software_should_i_use/)
TL;DR - DaVinci Resolve, Hitfilm Express, Olive Editor or Kdenlive
___

# Footage type
Are your videos 1080p60 or 4k?

systems struggle to edit those videos
* how *professional industry* has handled this for **decades** is to use Proxies
	* a copy of our media in a lower resolution and possibly a "friendlier" codec

so first question to ask is that,
do you need this proxy workflow?
___

# Hardware

generally, the hardware minimums are
* intel i7
	* due to intel Quick Sync
* 16GB RAM
* a GPU with 2+ GB of GPU RAM
	* GPUs do not help with the codec/playback of media but do help with visual effects.
* an SSD
___

# Simplest software

iMovie is by far the easiest-to-use editor
* sadly only Mac can use it

> [!failure] Sad fact
> There isn't a lightweight, easy-to-use free/inexpensive editor that we'd recommend for Windows the way we recommend iMove

The closest on Windows is Olive editor

# Suggested softwares

Tools that charge but also have very usable free versions

	* needs a strong video card or hardware
	* max size is UHD
	* Mac/Win/Linux
	* Full proxy workflow
* Hit Film
	* freemium, pay for extra features
	* Mac/Win
	* Full proxy workflow

Something easy, but not popular
* Adobe Rush
	* Free, no watermarks
	* Win/Mac/Android/iOS
	* need an Adobe account
	* but need to buy a subscription if you want mobile to desktop transfer or Rush to Premiere transfer
* ClipChamp
	* bought by Microsoft
	* has a freemium tier
* CapCut
	* have mobile tools
	* be careful that the really good features are buried into a subscription

The *professionals* tools, all have costs
* Adobe Premiere Pro
	* suggested for *most people*
* Apple Final Cut Pro
* Avid Media Composer
* BMD DaVinci Resolve

Open Source tools, *but there is no UI team/support*
* Kdenlive
	* Windows/Linux
	* Full proxy workflow
	* good for low-end computers
	* standard color-grading tools
	* some features are locked behind a paywall
	* Lacks in VFX / text tool barebones
* Olive Editor
	* in the middle of a major rewrite, may be unstable
	* the easiest editor
	* actively developed, but still has less features
