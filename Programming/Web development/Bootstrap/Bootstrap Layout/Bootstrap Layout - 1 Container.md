[Containers Â· Bootstrap v5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/containers/)

> [!quote]
> Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.

* most basic layout element in Bootstrap
* **required** when using Bootstrap's default grid system
* containers can be nested, although most layouts don't require a nested container

Bootstrap comes with 3 types of containers:
see them in action in [Grid Template # Containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/grid/#containers)

1. `.container` - default container
* which sets a `max-width` at each responsive breakpoint
* its width depends on breakpoints, unless the viewport width is Extra small
* responsive, but fixed-width
* = `.container-sm`

2. `.container-{breakpoint}` - responsive container
* which is `width: 100%` until the specified breakpoint
* its width is the same as viewport width until the viewport width reaches a certain breakpoint
	* if the viewport width keep increasing, its width would remain the same until reached the next breakpoint

3. `.container-fluid` - fluid containers
    which is `width: 100%` at all breakpoints
    its width is always the same as viewport width
