# What is a Portal?

A discontinuity in 3D space
* the back face of a 2D rectangle is defined to be the front face of another 2D rectangle located elsewhere

* but we're not manipulating the 3D space at all
	* it doesn't make any sense any way

It's as simple as a door
* we walk through it, there is a different room

> [!fun fact]
> In the game Portal, there are actually standard doors that are actually portals.
> Long story short, it's due to the room needs to move.

# Rendering a Portal

The preliminary way, was Render Texture
* this is what they did in Narbacular Drop, the predecessor to Portal

Later in the Portal franchise, they switched to use *Stencil Buffer*


## Trade-off

**Using Render Texture**
* we need separate textures per portal view
	* if we support for recursion, we have to have many, many texture pre-allocated
	* consume many memory very fast
* we need to look for the deepest portal and render that one first, then the outer portals
	* we can't change the order
* can't use antialiasing
* But it's the simplest way, especially if we don't support recursion at all

**Stencil**
* we only need a single pass
* renders entire frame in the back buffer. no texture memory needed.
* we start from the main view and then recurse as necessary
* guaranteed to get homogeneous visual quality
* but have a lot of complexity of when to render them and how to render them


## High Level Portal

At the highest level, how a portal works, is effectively just virtual camera
* when we look through the orange portal, that needs to be the same as looking from behind the blue portal
* if any thing moves, if any pixel is not in the exact same place, the math is wrong
