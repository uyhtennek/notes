# Why use binary digit, aka bit?

At the end of the day, computer is powered by electricity. To represent a thing, it's either store a electricity or don't store electricity.
**On / Off**
**1 / 0**

Inside of any computer, there are some number of switches, known as transistors.

okay, so 000 = 0, 001 = 1, 010 = 2, ..., 111 = 7
but how about 8?
1000 = 8
___
# Letters in computer

It's represented by number in computer, again, in bit.
A = 65 = 01000001
**ASCII**, American Standard Code for Information Interchange

but how computer distinguish letters and numbers?
**file format**, or more precisely, **program**

in Image Viewer, a binary pattern is interpreted as color.
in Google Docs, it's a letter.
in Photoshop, it's a layer.
in Excel, it's a number.

developers determine how a pattern is interpreted in their program.
___
# Byte

1 byte = 8 bits = 0-255
**ASCII uses 8 bits only**. but we got more than 256 letters in the real world, now what?

**Unicode**
= power-up version of ASCII. use 16 bits or even 32 bits.

however sometimes manufacturers interpret Unicode differently. so it can lead to miscommunitcation.
___
# RGB

a color scheme that can tell the amount of red, green, blue in a **pixel**, which is just a dot on the screen
typically a pixel contains 24 bits. 8 for red, 8 for green, 8 for blue.
___
# Video & Audio

they're sequence of images.
similarly audio or music are sequence of notes, or **MIDI** in computers.
___
# more notes
different computers may use different number of bits to represent the same data type
___
