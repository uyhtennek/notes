[SuperSessions 2021: How to Be a Leaner, Faster Game Developer | Vinicius Pachá](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnqytPQW5w8)
don't spend 3 years on a game just to see it fail
take the lean approach to game development → focus on the most profitable features

# Focus On CPI

if the CPI isn't low enough, then it's important to scrap your game before you get past the sweet spot and start spending too many resources on your prototype

> [!tip] Use video to prove CPI
> run the CPI test more quickly by taking a video-first approach:
> a feature is only worth including in your MVP, if it can be understood and translated well in your video, if not, scrap it
> 
> Focus on the core gameplay shown in your video - it needs to be satisfying and clear enough that users know how your game works within three seconds.

not every features are essential for a game
just develop the cores and put up a good video featuring the juicy mechanics

# Use Templates

save time by starting with a template
never start from scratch
___

# Think Ahead

whatever you're creating now, think about how you can use it in the future
so we can speed up development again and again
___

# Avoid common mistakes

generally, don't do more than it needs
* confirm the game passes the CPI test first
* it's important to focus on CPI as the sole benchmark of success


## Not buying assets

hyper-casual game stands out on gameplay alone
* assets just need to be visually appealing, not stunning
* no shame in buying assets

so buy assets to save time
* remember the product-value curve


## Making many levels too early

since you don't know if the game will pass the CPI test
* don't waste time building out 20 levels
* even if you do, you can't showcase all of these levels in videos because it'd be too expensive

start by building out 3-5 levels and make them a loop
* so users play through them endlessly

if the game shows promising CPI, then we can start building out more levels and focusing on boosting in-game metrics, like retention


## Solving problems you don't have

if you have a good idea, but it's not coming across well on mobile,
you should still make it and test it
* if it has good CPI, we can address the technical issue later


## Fixing bugs

same as above,
bugs can be costly in time, so fix them when low CPI is confirmed


## Adding sound

sounds need some time to find
and often introduce some bugs

at prototyping, your game is only featured in a video
* if you think it needs sound, just add some music or sound effects on top of the video


## Making complex game

again, time is the key
don't waste time making mechanics that not serving CPI
* keep it simple, stupid
* an MVP with just a few levels and simple design is best
	* if the core gameplay and concept is marketable, we can build the rest out later
___

# Fail fast, fail often

learn from each failure
build templates based on what did work to help streamline the next prototype
only doing what's necessary for running a CPI test
