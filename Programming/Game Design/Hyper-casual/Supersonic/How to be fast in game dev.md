[3 strategies for working fast in hyper-casual games](https://supersonic.com/learn/blog/3-strategies-for-working-fast-in-hyper-casual-games/)
unlike other more complex genres, hyper-casual games are straightforward to develop
* so we can push out MVPs for testing marketability in a matter of days

# Use Templates

templates can include
* basic elements such as the game menu, the win and lose screens, and the in-game store
* slightly complex elements such as different models or game mechanics
	* eg. collection models, like coins or some objects
		* how a character navigates the game to pick it up
		* the visual cues that appear during this process
	* eg. haptics or the touch mechanics

eg. Supersonics made templates for rotation models
* how user applies their finger to rotate an on-screen 3D object

use templates to remove avoidable development overheads

# New Stage Daily

game development is split into three parts
* game design, game development, and game art
* for hyper-casual developers to work fast and scale their output, we should move into a new phase of development every day or two

Day 1 - the game designer should define the basic mechanics of the game concept
* create a game design document
* eg. how high the character jumps, how fast they run, what haptics to use and where, ....

Once it's finished, the development team should take over to build out a MVP
a day or two later, game artists should come in and define the artistic vision of the game

continues working and refining until the game is ready for soft launch
* hopefully within a month

this workflow suit the medium sized games studios very well
because each time a person finishes a work on a certain game they can begin working on other projects right away

> [!info] alternative orders
> it doesn't have to be in the order of designer > developer > artist
> for an aesthetically-driven game concept, maybe the product should kickstart with the art stage

# Use Market Research Tools

eg. App Annie, Sensor Tower
* use them to identify market trends
	* mix the game trends with the trends coming from platforms like Tiktok and YouTube
* to increase the chance of creating a concept that sticks
