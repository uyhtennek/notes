# Voodoo Game Design
simple is best

Who are our players? Everyone.
* people that play our games on their smartphones, on the go

* when you're designing your game, think about this guy on the train
	* playing on one hand
		* so no double joystick allowed in our game, it just doesn't work
	* he looks relaxed, so don't threaten him with our game
	* he's going somewhere, so the game better be short to finish

* so these games would be perfect
* so mindless that we can play on one finger and without really thinking about it
	* in some games you can't even die or lose

# Voodoo guidelines

Hyper-casual games must be
1. **snackable** - the session length is short and gives a lot of reward
2. **intuitive** - players can understand them in a few seconds
3. **Youtubeable** - they're very dynamic and there's a lot of action going on
4. **forgiving** - punishment is low or none
5. **gameplay first** - we need to find that one little nugget of gameplay which is really exciting and fun, and everything else should be secondary to that

**What not to do**
* threatening mechanics, making the game stressful
	* eg. lava, quicksand, things that kill player on touch
	* could you play a game like this on a moving bus? probably not.
* making it complex
	* can the man on the tube or bus play the game with one hand, while standing on a crowded moving vehicle, for the first time?
	* can people see these CPI videos for a few seconds on Facebook and understand straight away what something is?
* too many elements
	* can players understand what type of game and what to expect from the moment they start playing the game?
