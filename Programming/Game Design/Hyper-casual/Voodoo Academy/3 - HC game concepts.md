# Concepting

they have a specfic ideation process:
1. Benchmark
2. Identification
3. Ideation
4. Conception
5. Concept selection

**Benchmark**
* Gather information
	* what are the hyper-casual top charts?
		* identify all the trending hyper-casual games
	* don't limit yourself to hyper-casual hits though
		* inspiration can be found anywhere
	* gather information, then try to come up with a concept based on it
* Knowledge
	* feed yourself with market reports, case studies, best practices, etc.
* Experience
	* learn from your failed prototypes or attempts, your past experience

**Identification**
* Synthesis
	* identify games' mechanics
	* eg. Stretch, Climb, Trim, Bike, First person
* Analysis
	* understand why something worked or didn't work
	* see the trends
	* extract the successful, the proven element
* Extrapolation
	* adapt the satisfactory element
	* use them, maybe in a different way

**Ideation**, they practice it as *Unconstrained exploratory phase*
* basically it means free brainstorming
	* write down all the ideas without a filter
	* it's an ongoing process
		* keep practicing it
	* no limitation, no stress
* they used a very basic spreadsheet with a few columns for this
	* key ideas, references, mechanic 1, mechanic 2, mechanic 3
* just put down some inspirations, exploring ideas
	* not worry about will they work or not

**Conception**
* classification
	* go over the ideas, explore more on them
	* try to merge and regroup them to get base ideas for concept
	* starting to have a clear idea and concept
* selection
	* select some ideas and translate them to a game concept
	* some of them may be better than others
		* maybe it's more innovative, or it meet the trends
* concept creation
	* develop an idea to a working game concept
	* create easy to understand document
		* they use some one page document for this
		* they send this exact document to developers for creating the game
		* better to have some references

**Concept Selection**
* they have tiers of game concept
* they come up with 10X more game concepts than they're able to produce
	* so 10 design concept documents on Trello when they're still working on 1 game
* therefore productions are well-organized
___

# Time Allocation

35% - Benchmark
20% - Identification
30% - Ideation → finished design document
10% - Conception
 5% - Selection
___

# Tools

they developed their own Benchmark tool
* flag and follow developer accounts
	* better to be developers that can bring up trends

player all their prototypes
* play for 30 seconds should be enough
* you just need to capture the core mechanic
