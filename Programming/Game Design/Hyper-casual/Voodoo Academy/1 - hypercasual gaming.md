# HC Economics


## 1. User Acquisition

**CPI**, *Cost Per Installation*
* this is the price paid for a given player

most of the users are bought through **video advertisements**
* we're paying a network such as Facebook, Snapshot, to run the ads
* converting these ad viewers to players
* eg. if I pay $1 to Facebook to run the ad, then it generates 4 players, we have a CPI of $0.25

the lower the CPI, the more mass market the game or video is


## 2. User Retention

eg. 100 players installed the game on Monday
* 45 of them are still playing on Tuesday
	* Day 1 Retention is 45%
* 15 of them are still playing on the next Monday
	* Day 7 Rentention is 15%

Playtime - average time spent on the game per player per day


## 3. Monetisation

in mobile we only have 3 types of ad
* Full Screen Ads
* Rewarded Videos
	* an opt-in ad that if a player chooses to watch it, then the game gives a reward
* Banners

combining these, we get the LTV, *Life Time Value*, of a player
* how many value we generate from a given player

> [!important] CPI < LTV
> To conclude, we're looking for the margin between CPI and LTV.
