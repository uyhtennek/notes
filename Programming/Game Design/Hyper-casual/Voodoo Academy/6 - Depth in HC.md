# What Is Depth?
basically, easy to play, hard to master

> [!info] 3 main pillars to depth
> Variety
> Accessibility
> Upskilling

Variety
* enables the player to have a different experience with the same content
* without us needing to add too much details to give fresh experience

Accessibility
* it fits all playstyles
* any one can have fun playing the game
	* from a new born to an elderly, even a monkey
* we also need to satisfy the midcore players who are looking for challenges

Upskilling
* as players learn and familiar themselve with the mechanics, they're gonna be better
* as they get better, we want to adjust the game difficulty to keep it fun
* and we don't want to do that by adjusting the designs
___

# Depth â‰  System 2

depth is about
* having very **clear** choices
	* difficulty needs to be **an option**
	* to make the game highly **replayable**
* players get rewards anyway
	* but they get more rewards if they choose the harder path

* gameplays can't be repetitive
	* it means the game doesn't have enough depth
* when players fail, they feel fair and not punishing
___

# Accessing Depth


**Runner examples**

eg. Draw Climber
* the mechanics is friendly to newbie and challenging for midcore players

eg. Helix Jump
* you can play safe to go down one level at a time
* you can go risky by skipping levels to go for a fever mode

eg. Shortcut Run
* you can run on tracks
* you can take shortcuts


**Puzzle examples**

eg. Dig This
* you win by reaching the goal
	* it's totally up to player how they dig the path out
* you can dig the shortest path

eg. 2048 Balls
* if you play 10 times, every time you can get a different experience
	* because players create different layouts of the puzzles for themselve

eg. Bounce & Collect
* the win condition is very easy
* the 3 stars condition is a bit more challenging
___

# How To Depth?
we have a Depth Check List

10 level rule
* if we pick a random level in the game, play it 10 times in a row, will the experience always be the same or will it feel different each time?
* if yes, it's plenty depth already
* if no, go back to the drawing board and re-think the mechanics

Noob vs Pro rule
* is the game both friendly to newbie and challenging for the pros?
* then, is there a skill cap?
	* as players get better in the game, is the experience able to adapt to the evolving playstyle?
	* is there always room for players to improve?

Does the player have different options?
* are there a variety of means to meet the end goal?
* also, are these options voluntary?
	* we can't force players an option, because if we did, it's not an option

> [!warning] It's HC games specific
> If your game don't meet these guidelines, it doesn't mean it's a bad game.
> But for mass appeal, it's better to check all these boxes.
> 
> Also, HC games don't neccessarily check all the boxes as well to be a hit as well.

# What Is Progression?
The pattern of advance and the movement towards the ultimate goal - winning the game

How do we maximise this player experience?
* the game itself offers a very rewarding experience
* people can repeat and replay the game, and still find it entertaining
	* playing it on Day 7 is as fun as playing it on Day 1
___

# Elements Of Progression

there are 4 elements that we can make progression
* Practical rewards
	* rewards that have some utility within the game
	* eg. unlock more resources, then player can play the game a little bit differently
* Ancillary rewards
	* purely visual rewards, or rewards that don't actually affect the gameplay
		* eg. skins
* New experiences
	* add variety and depth to the gameplay
	* keep players engaged and wanting more gameplay experiences
* Balancing
	* we don't want to burn out progression very quickly, neither progress so little or none
	* avoid overly engaging progression, and dis-engaging one


**Practical Rewards**
* rewards that can change the way that players play the game
* eg. boosters, incremental upgrades, unlockable gifts, etc.
* enhance a player's skill
* extremely effective in boosting further progression
* content-based

**Ancillary Rewards**
* purely visual, oral, or decorative
* eg. animations, fantastic environments, particle effects, scripted event actions, etc.
* players can feel rewarded during the gameplay
	* help them recognize that they progressed
* then they will be willing to play the game longer

**New experiences**
* reveal new features and elements, every 2-3 levels
* it feels different to play level 5 than level 1

**Balancing**
* avoid difficulty spikes and flat difficulty
* so difficulty curve should be smooth
	* matches player's skill level
___

# Tracking Progression

1. Create progression funnels
* identify where people are dropping off
	* there are two kinds of churn rate: how many people completed a level and how many people started the level after.
* figure out why that's happening
* a healthy churn rate is <5% across levels

2. Track win-rate
* if many people are dropping off in the same level, it's something wrong in that level
* we can track win-rates to optimise the difficult balancing of the gameplay
* different games have different optimal win-rates
	* both high win-rate and low win-rate can achieve high retention
* use it along with churn rate to see if there is problem in a level or certain part of the game
