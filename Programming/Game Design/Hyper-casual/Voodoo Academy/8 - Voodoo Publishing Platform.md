# Voodoo Publishing Walkthrough

1. Submit the prototype
2. Wait 4 days for the result
3. if the Voodoo team think it's a high potential prototype, they will guide you through launch
___

# Submit Games

many thing to setup
just following instructions
___

# TinySauce SDK

* lightweight
* easy to integrate
* used for prototyping only
	* if it's high potential, we'll use another SDK for more advanced functionality
* contains attribution and analytics SDKs
* so we can focus on the game
* it's updated regularly

again, just follow the steps
___

# Create Campaign

upload
* game icons
* game infos
* game videos
	* really really important
	* always upload 4 videos

then Voodoo team will review it
probably accept it within 1-2 business days
___

# Good Result

CPI - <$0.50
Retention D1 - 30%
Cumulative D3 Playtime - >12m

if the result doesn't hit these targets,
Voodoo recommend to move on to the next idea


## other metrics

CPNU, *cost per new user*
* these are users that not come from the Facebook ads
	* they just find the game on Play Store / App Store
* the organic users
* if CPNU is lower than CPI, that means some users are organic users
	* so if CPNU is largely lower than CPI, it's a very good signal
	* showing that there is some virality to the game

Global gender split
* 50% is the perfect number

Total new users
* how many users you got so far

Daily playtime
* include both D3 users and D1 users
* so a bit of bias

Daily session per user

Retention D7
* it becomes important if the prototype is high potential

More additional metrics
but they are much less important so don't get shown on the dashboard
___

# How Facebook Advertise?

they don't advertise all your 4 videos
they choose the best performaning one and adjust effort and budget accordingly
