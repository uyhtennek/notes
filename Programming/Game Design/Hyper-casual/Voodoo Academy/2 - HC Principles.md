# System 1 vs System 2
It's a way to categorise games based on the **amount of mental effort** they ask to the player.

| System 1 | System 2 |
| :-: | :-: |
| Instinctive | Brainy |
| Effortless | Challenging |
| Repeatable / Durable | Temporary |
| Fast | Slow |
| Automatic | |

so which is better?
* given the HC games' target audience, it's System 1
* because players are kinda lazy

so always go brainless? that's the answer?
* too easy is not good either
* we need to find the right balance
* but HC games always need high clarity
	* think about when people see the ads of a game
	* can they understand the gameplay within 2 seconds?

System 1 eg. Cube Surfer

# System 1 Checklist

Gameplay is understandable within 3 seconds
* eg. Slice It All, Blob Merge
	* Blob Merge is very automatic yet very easy to understand within 3 seconds
	* it's 2048 but emphasize just colors and sizes instead of numbers
		* from 70% CPI to below 20% CPI
* remember, easy-to-understand gameplay, clarity makes low CPI

"Even your mom should be able to understand the game."
* eg. Cube Surfer, Spiral Roll
	* Spiral Roll went from 3 lanes to just 1 lane
	* must less thing to handle
	* improve both CPI and retention

Snackability
* so the game is durable and fast
* the pacing and levels of the game should be fast to make player engaged
* eg. Fat To Feed
* eg. Roof Rails
	* they shorten the levels, increase the number of session played
	* increases in playtime, retention, overall LTV

Remember, System 1
