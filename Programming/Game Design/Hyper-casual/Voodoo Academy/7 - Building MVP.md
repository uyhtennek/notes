# Why MVP?

we build the MVP as quick as possible, so that we can get the **initial metrics** as quick as possible
* the data gathered from the first testing

After we get the metrics, we ask the first question:
Either should we iterate the game, or we kill it?
* if an idea is not working, it's highly recommended to kill it early
___

# Lean Mindset

Finish prototyping in **3-5 days after ideation**
* so 5 days to make a game

We test the prototype on 3 things:
1. its initial **CPI values**
	* it's worth developing only if this number is good
2. its **retention**, especially Day 1 retention
	* so that we can see the idea's **retention potential**
3. how the game is played by players?
	* what is the main gameplay dynamics? are the features working out? how do the level funnels look? where does it lose players?


## CPI

and remember, CPI depends on
* uniqueness of the idea
* clarity
* simplicity
* fun
So, initial CPI doesn't mean much without the MVP meeting these 4 criterias

eg. Cube Surfer
* made within 2 days by a 2 people studio
* gameplay never changed since MVP
* it's just more polished


## Retention

to truly see the retention potential, the MVP should fulfill the following requirements:
1. no major bugs
	* no bug that affect the gameplay
2. core game mechanic with clear win or lose conditions
3. clear, idiot-proof onboarding
	* players understand the game immediately
4. enough contents, like 5-10 levels
	* then we can mirror or replicate these levels

# Things To Avoid

> [!info] Mindset
> 1. if the core mechanic is good, we can see good Day 1 retention even with just a few levels
> 2. we don't need to see a very very good metrics right from the get go, because we just need to see if there is potential

Avoid
1. polishing the game too much
	* the MVP needs to be unique, clear, simple, and fun
	* but it doesn't need more than that
	* still needs the main things in place though, like clear color contrasts
2. menu
3. meta
	* eg. shops, upgrades
4. avatar customization
5. multiple environments or zoning

Why?
* they won't add anything to your Day 1 retention
* they take too much time to build

Don't waste time on ideas that don't have potential
Idea is everything and the only thing for a MVP
* only idea contributes to Day 1 retention

# MVP Hacks

| Time costly things | Hacks |
| :-: | --- |
| Assets | Use old assets. Use Asset Store. Make really simple assets. |
| New levels | Mirroring (flip x-axis). Turning 90Â° (eg. Roller Splat). |
| Visual polish | Only for CPI videos, not for the main build. |
| Optimization | Don't optimize except fixing major bugs. |
