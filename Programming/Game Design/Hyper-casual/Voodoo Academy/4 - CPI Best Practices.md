# What Is CPI?

CPI = CPM x CTR x CVR

CPI = Cost Per Install
* lower is better

CPM = Cost Per Mile
* how much it costs to show an ad for a game to 1,000 viewers
* we try to deliver the ads to a bigger market

CTR = Click-Through Rate
* percentage of viewers who click on the ad and get redirected to the App Store or Play Store
* our primary focus when we're crafting our ad video

CVR = Conversion Rate
* rate of users who end up installing the game after landing on the store listing page
* don't contribute very much for the game so it's not our priority in testing

> [!question] Why CPI is Vital?
> looking from Voodoo's past data, all their successful games have a CPI lower than $0.20

___

# How CPI Is Tested?
on Voodoo publishing platform

1. upload the game to the App Store
2. create a number of ad videos
3. set up a test on Voodoo's publidash
	* it initiates a low-scale ad campaign
	* in networks such as Facebook and Snapchat

> [!warning] Testing CPI â‰  CPI at scale
> It's just a testing after all. Voodoo's testing network is very good at targeting the right audience. It could be targeted at an niche group that has maybe a few thousand users.
> 
> When the game is targeted at 2 million people, we expect the CPI will go higher than the testing result.
> 
> So this is one reason why HC game needs to target to all people but not an niche group of people. Avoid themes like sports, cars, superheros, insects, monsters, etc. Use universal themes like foods, paints, arts, crafts, money, etc.

# How To Ad Video?

**The basics**
* mass-market visuals
	* theme and art style that pleases everyone
	* or displeases no one if you like to take it in reverse
* colors
	* bright and cheerful
	* green = good, red = danger, gray = neutral = good for environment and platforms
* really high contrasts
	* look at your videos from afar
	* if everything still can pop out, it's good
* gameplay clarity
	* the ad video is answering 2 questions: what's happening? what do I need to do?
		* so what's the core mechanics? what are the win and lose condition?
	* you have 3-5 seconds or shorter time span to lure the player
		* so prioritize your information
	* is it overwhelming? is everything essential?
		* how many different information are happening?
		* are they consistent with their colors or shapes or etc.
		* hoe many layers of abstraction are needed to understand the gameplay?
			* how many mental processing it requires to understand what winning means and what losing means?
			* ng. puzzle games typically have a high CPI
	* eg. Cube Surfer
___

# Art Style

> [!question]
> if everything needs to be so simple, why don't we just always use cubes and spheres?
> 
> it's a fair point, and it's actually the case in the market of 2017, 2018, when the market is not as crowded and sopisticated. In today's market, it's not enough.

CPI-friendly art needs to look relatable, and it needs to serve the gameplay
* cubes and spheres are too abstract, users can't relate them to anything
* figurative visuals, with universal themes remember, are useful to clarify the gameplay and attract viewer's attention
	* eg. Slick It All
* Less is more
	* we don't need everything to be figurative
	* we can apply them to items that we wish to highlight only
* if no figurative design suits the gameplay, materials and textures are useful alternatives
	* eg. wooden background
		* it feels like you can touch them, it's something we know
		* it's always better than a plain white very abstracted background
* things need to be juicy
	* eg. things look bouncy, wobbly, stretchy, etc.
	* they're strong visual hook
		* so that the viewers stop browsing the social media to stop to watch the ad video for a second or two
	* eg. Bounce And Collect, Spiral Roll
		* very compelling-looking, felt really new
		* so very eye-catching
	* eg. Ball Versus Rope
		* very relatable graphics lead to easy-to-understand mechanics and controls
___

# Viewer Engagement In Ads

**Timer Is Everything**
* make every seconds count
* 75% of users who do watch the ad, will leave before the 5 seconds mark
	* basically nothing can get shown beyond that point
* we need strong visual hook from second 1
* gameplay should be understandable with 1 frame
* keep the action interesting throughout the video
	* last for at least 10 seconds
* it's better to cast a wide net
	* ie. create ads that start with different situations
	* ng. different situations in a single video, because it'd be too late to be shown

**Innovation**
* it's the best way to reach low CPI
* viewers are less likely to engage with content that is close to what have seen before
* the closer your game is to an existing hit, the more likely you are in a competing situation
	* inflate CPIs as a result
* always aim for "wow effect" gameplays
	* creating a game that is different is not the goal
	* creating a game that can **wow** players, is our purpose
* eg. Draw Climber
	* makes Draw mechanics recurring in big hits

**Storytelling**
* know your **"moments"**
	* there are some critical moments in your game, that make your games unique and fun
	* you should know what these moments are, before you even start coding
* starting at the paper stage, you can already think of the funny clips or scenarios
* results in engaging movies and good CPI

**Intention**
* play with the viewer's feelings
* eg. Scribble Rider
	* the ad is incredibly frustrating
	* the player in the ad video perform poorly, yet the viewer knows the answer and presumingly they can perform better, making it painful for the viewer to watch
	* so it hooks the viewers
		* "I want to do better than this guy.", "I want to know if my answer is right."
* maximize engagement by showing different playstyles in different videos
	* "FAIL" is a must have
		* lose or fail the level
		* over-perform quite often the others playstyle
	* "PRO"
		* best possible course of action, best strategy for the game
	* "FRUSTRATING"
		* you play poorly making viewers wanting to donwload the game and do better
	* "SATISFYING"
___

# Ideation And Development

it's easier said than done, eg.
* the game is not as marketable as you thought
* you have a hard time finding or making a mass-market visual assets that benefit the game well
* you realise that the game is not impressing looking enough to hook players
* the game looks too similar to a previously launched game, and you don't know how to differentiate yourself
	* if this is the game, probably this is the game you never should have developed

> [!important] Always have CPI in mind, before you even write the first line of code.

**Ideation**
1. keep everything mass-market
	* no niches
2. stay original, because you're late any way
	* it's tempting to make the mechanics that you identified as the trend
	* but remember the games on the top chart right now, probably are developed a couple of months back
	* at that time it was new, so that's why it worked
		* you may not be able to replicate the success
3. know what will sell your game before you make it
	* imagine ad ideas when the idea is still on paper

> [!tip] Execute Or Kill It?
> If you cannot fulfill these requirements, you properly should kill the idea.
> Save yourself from two weeks of work for nothing.

**Execution**
1. prioritize development of features that will help CPI
	* invest on wow moments
	* rather than things like making more levels
2. based gameplay on what looks fun
	* because if it looks fun, it feels fun
3. Don't hesitate to test ads that look different from the actual game
	* your ads don't need to 100% like your game
	* fun gameplay might not be suitable for ads
		* so make it looks fun in the ads, but deliver the intended and presumingly addicting gameplay in the actual game
		* eg. puzzle games can be complicated to understand in 2 seconds
			* simplify the gameplay, or make overly simplified level for the ads
		* eg. changing the game goal in the ads, even it's actually not in the game itself
	* fake gameplay can be efficient for marketing
___

# Intention

Voodoo has 6 recommended intentions for ad videos:
* Win and Fail
	* showcase the win situation and the lose situation
* Pro and Noob
	* showcase the perfect playstyle and the worst playstyle
* Frustrating and Satisfying
	* play fairly bad or create a stressful situation
	* or have a crazily satisfying footage

> [!tip] We can combine intentions if we think one intention isn't enough.

___

# Clarity

**Gameplay first**
* gameplay starts at frame 1
	* cut to the fun part in the first few seconds
* add useful UI if needed
* speed up the video to bring in the juicy part of the game more quickly

**Simplify and Highlight**
* have a clean design
* limit number of visual effects
	* add visual effects at the highlight of the game
* not too much details
* remove useless UI
* emphasize contrast
	* make objects pop
* eg. if color is not important, use white or gray
* eg. if texture or material is not important, use the abstract white and gray grid
___

# Unity Recorder

It has 2 benefits:
1. FPS is not capped by the device
2. we have total control over the game

Common settings
* Add Recorder > Movie
* Playback > Constant
* Target FPS > 60
* Media File Format > H.264 MP4

If the output is blurred or some other problems arise, try
* changing the media file format
* reduce colors or adding white background
	* media encoder often have hard times compressing many colorful visual effects
* decreasing the gameplay speed
	* lower time scale, higher timestamp
* sometimes the problem is the Facebook or the platform, then try compress the video as much as possible before uploading
___

# Facebook Format

it's not 1080 x 1920
it's 800 x 1000

but sill, record the video in 1080 x 1920
then crop the video to 800 x 1000, just remember to keep the gameplay happening in the center of the 1080 x 1920 game view screen
___

# CPI Checklist

* at least 4 videos
* 30 seconds long each
* show clear intention in the first seconds
* gameplay first
* focus on clarity
* high contrast
* 1080 x 1920 format
