# Game Mechanics
theme: slap people

there are 6 challenges within the gameplay
1. reach the end of the level
2. build as many strength as you game throughout the level and get to kick further at the end of each level on the ruler board
3. once you've completed the level, you're given a number of stars out of three depending how well you performed in the level

challenges that are not always there
4. a shiny guy holding up a key
5. additional challenges like Slap x1 cop, Slap x70 people
6. at the end of each level, there's an automated leaderboard showing the 'Total Slaps - Ranking' worldwide. the more levels you play, the further up the ranking you go.

# Strong Ideation Process
eg. OHM Games, 501, Stone Axe Studio

one of Voodoo's ideation techniques is **Start from experience**
* the game's inspiration actually came from GTA: VC
	* Billy, the developer, likes to annoy people in VC and have them chase him
* another inspiration is there are many prank videos all over the Internet
* so the idea suddenly popped for him
* then he did some market research and realised that there were no slap/runner games in the market, so he knew this was a high potential idea

again, there is a checklist of things for this technique
1. Universal appeal
	* prank is basic human behaviour
2. Reminiscent of childhood games
	* it reminds people of GTA: VC
	* it's a feeling that many people share
3. Addresses an urge
	* people can't just slap people and run in real life
	* the game addresses this urge for people

As a result
first round of testing hit a 16c CPI

# Depth

1. lower win rate
* games nowadays are easy, have high win-rate
* Slap and Run on the other hand, has a win-rate of 50%
	* so challenging gameplay adds a little bit of depth

2. risk/reward balance
* in the game, adding risks is adding rewards
* again, difficulty is an option
	* playstyles from maximise rewards to minimise risks

3. both basic gameplay and the 'perfect run' are super clear, so often times users will aim for 100% completion
* colour scheme is super obvious as well
	* player is blue, opponents are purple, obstacles are red
* it follows the 'rule of three', that indicates that the gameplay is clear enough
	* only three layers that players need to understand
	* these layers stand out instantly

As a result, day 1 retention is 41%
