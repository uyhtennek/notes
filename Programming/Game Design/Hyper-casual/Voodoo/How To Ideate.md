[Voodoo Fall Game Competition - How To Ideate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U04CO3AA7XY)
the general procedures
1. Benchmark - finding inspiration
2. Ideate
3. Structure ideas
4. Prioritise ideas
5. Prototype and then Test
___

# Depth Is Mass Market

depth is about catering different behviours
* therefore different experiences
* therefore different users

also it introduces choices
* usually based on skill level

Flat Gameplay → User A
Deep Gameplay → User A, B, C, D, E
___

# Why Ideation Matters?
actually, it's the most important part of game development

creative works are all about ideas
* we don't want to wait until one day good ideas strike
* we generate ideas systematically

Ideation determines your chance to launch
* from Voodoo's stats, an average studio may have 25 ideas, 25 prototypes
	* 10 of them get to worth iterating
	* only 1 or 2 of them get to launch
* but, it's not ideal
	* it's better to have 250 ideas
	* then 25 prototypes
* why? it makes it a number game.
	* for 10 structured ideas, you pick the best one
	* then it's a lot less likely turn out to be a bad idea
* then many of them are probably worth iterating
* the launches you get should be much more than the previous strategy
___

# Model & Improve

We get an inspiration, whatever it is, we ask
how can we transform this to a hypercasual game?
* what's the fun part or what is the really satisfying part?

what am I solving for?
how am I fixing or improving flaws?

why are these games a great merge?
* eg. Slice It All = Flappy Dunk + ASMR Slice

eg. Mushroom Wars is a popular Steam game
* there are many similar Command & Conquer games in Flash
* City Takeover takes the inspiration
	* apply a hypercasual control on it - simple draw
	* added some classic hypercasual elements as well such as stacking
		* they are recommended because they are proven mechanics
___

# Merge gameplays

eg. Cube Surfer brought Snake vs Blocks and stacking to 3D
* Roof Rails pivoted Cube Surfer through horizontal stacking
	* their initiative was the sliding mechanics though
* then High Heels leverages both vertical stacking and sliding
___

# Start From Experience

this feels like a blue ocean and it seems need a bit of luck to come up with
OHM games actually said they're using a very systematic approach

> [!info] The 3 Pillars
> Player Feeling
> Mechanic
> Theme
> 
> Just a feeling isn't enough, it needs to be harmonious to the mechanic and the theme.
> So every time you say you have a great idea, the truth is, you only have one-third of it.
> 
> It's free to start from any one of the pillars,
> but it's important to have all the pillars.

**Player Feeling**
* it feels like this is a big part for effective studios start an idea
* the feeling might be come up from the mechanics or come from the users themselve
* eg. Satisfying, Frustrating, Power, Perfection, Accomplishment, Self-Expression, Magnifying reality (like stacking, snowballing), Sense of rhythm, Fear, Anticipation, Breaking the Rules, ....

**Mechanic**
* eg. Jumping, Cutting, Colliding, Flipping, Running, Digging, Dropping, Connecting, Sliding, Stacking, Shooting, .....
* it's important to think about what feelings the key mechanic is delivering

**Theme**
* eg. Feminine - Nails, Heels, Hair, etc., Light Narrative - figurative vs abstract, Children's games - aquapark, red light/green light, "Balls", Hair Styling, Fashion, Wealth, Food, Life vs Death, .....
* ng. Basketball, Soccer, Football, Ski/Winter sports, Guns/War, Cars/Road, Fantasy like dragons
	* they can do well in testings, but never scale vertically
