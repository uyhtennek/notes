[Make Games - Finishing a Game](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/1136623767/finishing-a-game)
take "finishing a game" as a skill
* that you can improve on
* because many people didn't finish their games
___

# 1. Choosing An Idea

![finishgame02.jpg (500Ã—300) (derekyu.com)](http://www.derekyu.com/tumblr/finishgame02.jpg)

*Games I want to make* are games where the process itself seems fun.
*Games I want to have made* are games where I'm more interested in the result than getting there.
*Games I'm good at making* are games that are suited to my personality and which I'm good at.

The ideas with the most potential falls into all three categories,
and also satisfy the requirement "I have the time and resources to actually make this."
___

# 2. Start Making

It's easy to confuse "preparing to start the damn game" with "starting the damn game"
* so, even creating a game engine is not necessarily starting the game
___

# 3. Avoid Unnecessary Works
unless you have to

Do you really need to write your own engine for this game?
Is what you want to do impossible to do with what's already out there?
Would you be reinventing the wheel?
___

# 4. Prototype

you get to know more about the game you're making once you start making
___

# 5. Core Mechanics
make sure the core mechanics are fun

Find core mechanics that are just fun to play around with
* it should be fun to execute the most basic interactions
	* because that's what players will be doing the most when they play your game
* ultimately, you want this core to drive your development
	* this will make it a lot easier for you later on, when you have to cut out parts of the game

If, along the way, you discovered a mechanic that's more fun than the original core mechanic that you came up with, consider making that the new core mechanic
___

# 6. Choose Good Partners
or work alone as long as you can

because there are many to consider
* personality, experience, timing, mutual interest, etc.

You don't want to be in a position where either you or the other person is far less dedicated
* so test each other out a bit with some smaller projects
* because it's devastating when a key person drops out after months or years of development

And you are very likely to have finished projects to attract good partners

Alternatively, find free graphics and music to use, at least as placeholders
___

# 7. Grind
game-making is tedious and downright unfun

there are many details that you didn't think of, but end up speding many time to work on
* it's inevitable
* these details are what make a game feel complete
___

# 8. Deadlines
Use awards, competitions, and other events as real deadlines

Deadlines can help you finish a project
* force you to have realistic plans
* force you to make hard decisions

Competitions are great to participate in, because
* the deadlines are very real
* the rewards are very real
	* eg. recognition, awards, money, ....
* you can connect with a community of like-minded people
___

# 9. Push Forward

you don't make every step perfect
you don't make sure that every step is perfect

you move on
___

# 10. Health
take care of your mental and physical health

sleep, exercise, eat
* because if you don't, you can't make games

you want to be working at your full potential
* you don't want to have a burn out and then quit

having some doubt about your project is perfectly natural
getting depression or falling into illness is not
___

# 11. Don't Start Over

> [!quote]
> My code's a mess. And I've learned so much already. If I started over I could do it a lot better and faster, and then the rest of the game will go a lot faster, too!

Yes. It's true. But no, don't start over.
* because your code will always be a mess, and you will have learned a lot
* it will never be perfect
* even if you do start over, you will find yourself in the exact same situation when you get to this point again
* it's a terrible trap

> [!quote] Here's a joke
> A man spends his entire life working on a game engine so perfect that all he has to do is press one button and the perfect game will come out of it. He never finishes it.

If bad organization is really slowing you down, go back and do some surgery on it so that you feel better. If it works but it's a bit hacky, then be brave and press on!
___

# 12. Maybe Next Time

partway through development you have this great new idea that's going to blow everyone's mind,
but you'll have to redo your whole game to implement it. Then just save it for the next game.

Assuming this game won't be the last game you ever make, hopefully
Finish this one first!
___

# 13. Cut It Out

you're behind schedule, and you have these ideas that would take you ages to finish half of them
* it's great!

now you get to decide what is really important to your game, and what you could cut
* the fact is, if we all had unlimited resources and unlimited time, we would all make the same crappy, meandering everything game
	* and there'd be no reason to play at all
* it's our limited resources and time that forces us to make tight games that feel like they have a purpose

If you've been building upon some core concepts that are provably fun, just keep cutting until you get to the very edge of that core
* everything else is probably just fluff you could do without
* or worse, it's fluff that's preventing people from seeing the best parts of your game
___

# 14. Quit

sometimes, it is time to call it quits
* maybe there's just no way you'll ever finish
* maybe it's just too big a mess to cut anything out
* maybe the rest of your team has quit already
* although now you know how to finish a game, you shouldn't be experiencing this ever again

after you quit, scale down your next project
* not scale up
* you might think "my skills are improving. I'm learning from my failure so I should be able to do more next time."
* but in reality, your projects become less and less finished

so you should go back down, down, down to a point that, your goal might even beneath you
* and it's very possible that it'll still end up being a bigger struggle than you thought
___

# 15. The Last 10 Precent
They say the last 10 percent is really 90 percent

It's true. It's the details that end up taking a lot of time.
* maybe you coded a competent combat system in a week, but making it great and making it complex and bug-free and ....., these things can take months
* You'll probably do a "final lap" sprint many times before you get to the real final lap

If this sounds discouraging, it shouldn't.
* although it can be harrowing, it can also be an enormously satisfying time in the development
* because stuff really does seem to "just come together"
___

# 16. Release

You just leveled up!
* increased confidence
* gained a reputation for being able to complete projects
* gained an understanding of the entire process of game creation

The best part, people can play your game
therefore, YOU ARE A GAME DEVELOPER
