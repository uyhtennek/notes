# Indie
what "indie" means?

> [!warning] outdated post
> This was some many years ago but people once make a definition for it.

1. Independent / Individual
* as in no publisher

2. Small studio
* roughly 20 members or less

this maybe the most percise definition because it excludes
* companies like Valve and Double Fine, are independent, but too large to be "indie"
* games that "feels indie" but not self-published
___

# School?
no, because no one cares about degrees

because some of its most prominent members are drop-outs or never-beens
* John Carmack, Cliff Bleszinski, Jonathan Blow, and Team Meat, all are in this club

college isn't necessarily bad though
* Derek Yu studied computer science in college, but it was far from a perfect experience

The point is make something
* eg. games, mods, art, and music
* if school helps you with that, great
* if it doesn't, you might want to adapt a different strategy because schooling is spending your most valuable resources: time and money
___

## If school, what to study?

major in computer science
or in illustration, concept art, and 3d modeling

stay far away from design-only schools or curricula
* they are either scams or not actual game-making

also find out that whether or not the school owns what you make
___

# Start making something

1. don't get ahead of yourself
* don't worry about tools, teams, platforms, deals, marketing, awards, right from the get go
* like, before you've even gotten a sprite moving around the screen

2. the author recommended Game Maker and Unity
* for a wealth of tutorials and plug-ins online

3. Get active in a game-making community

4. Keep making games
* [Ira Glass on Storytelling on Vimeo|despite that it's hard](https://vimeo.com/24715531)
* you need to make a lot of games
	* put yourself on a deadline

# Tips

## 1. [[Finshing a Game|Finish your games]]

## 2. Don't skimp on artwork

artwork is important
unique style of artwork, is important

if you have no artistic talent, go for style and coherency
* as many successful indie developers do
* even ugly is probably better than generic, all told
* Remember: this is most people's first impression of your game

## 3. Don't blame marketing

marketing is only a multiplier
failures come down to the craft is not good enough

marketing is not going to make or break you
* be honest with your game

## 4. Indie is not a genre or aesthetic

Make the game you want to make, not what you think an inde game "should be"
* don't feel pressured to be dishonest about what you'd like to do
* after all, you are making an indie game, an independent game

## 5. Build a healthy environment

You'll want to focus all of the energy available to you toward creating, and it's amazing how much of it can be lost to seemingly mundane things.
* so figure out your physical working space
* as well as your personal support system

## 6. Stay independent

it's tempting to sell yourself or your ideas to someone else for a bit of a feeling of security
but once you go down that road it's hard to come back

every moment you're simply securing may not be a moment you're progressing
* but don't be reckless though
* just know that you need to stay committed and focused on the task at hand

Also, don't give up your IP or in any way limit your opportunities long term
* keep exclusivity timed
* think long-tail
* because the future might benefit you and your works
	* i guess the author is saying that you should know the risks

## 7. Create your own luck

Put your self out there. Make some friends.
* You never know when serendipity will strike.
* but when it does, it will likely be related to situations in your past when you chose to actively engage someone or some idea.

## 8. Avoid "business as war"

don't be scared of people, doing business should be fairly pleasant
* do walk away from bad deals though

## 9. No gimmicks

focus on making a good game
* a deep, interesting, unique game
* rather than devising cheap tricks to grab people's attention

a gimmick is a short-term, high-risk solution
if we have to take risks (as we always have to), they should be honest, worthwhile ones
* because they tend to be less risky in the long run

## 10. You are your game

as an indie game developer, your game will likely be more "you" than a game made by hundreds or thousands of people
* so you have to understand yourself quite well in order to make a truly successful game

unraveling of what makes you "you" is something you should be doing any way
* and it goes hand in hand with your goal of being an independent creator
* Treasure it!
