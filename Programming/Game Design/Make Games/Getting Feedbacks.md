# What Is Feedback For?

1. Improve the game
* you get to see your game from the players' eyes
* so you can make adjustments accordingly to improve the experience for them
* alos, whatever part of the game you've been ignoring will have to be worked on until it reaches a baseline level of functionality
	* eg. if you plan a playtesting session, it may require you to implement working menus and fix that one bug that you know how to avoid but new players won't

2. Motivation
* seeing players interacting with your game is one good thing
* we can gain motivation from that

* not all type of games benefit well from conventions
___

# When To Ask For Feedback

1. Any time you put out something public-facing for your game, you'll get feedback

2. When you're feeling demotivated or just plain lost
* be mindful that the feedback you get from this will be sympathetic
* just to make you feel better
* doesn't mean you're doing a great job

3. you would want to solicit feedback directly, from time to time
* a good time is before you show off your game to the public
* also the feedbacks here are sympathetic

as you gain more experience as a game developer, you may feel more confident to go longer stretches without feedback
* can be good and bad
* good in a way that your game can feel personal and unique, as there are not much outside feedback directing you
