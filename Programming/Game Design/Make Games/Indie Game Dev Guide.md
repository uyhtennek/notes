# Archetypes

there are common troubles that are making people having a hard time to finish their games, so here are some archetypes for you to improve your skills on scoping and project management
___

## Daydreamer
the idea people

All idea, all talk, no practical plans
* do not understand the practical aspects of game development and lack the discipline to rein in their ideas when necessary
* artists and programmers with the requisite experience to finish a big project have almost certainly learned to avoid Idea People over the years

Note that someone who has shipped titles successfully on a team may still be a Daydreamer
* once they leave that structured environment they may struggle, having taken for granted their teammates or their budgets

They are likely to overscope and have a feature creep
but once they embrace the practical part of game development, it makes them better partners
___

## Inventor

they love building nice-looking prototypes because they're enamored with the thrill of new ideas, but they quickly lose interest once they have to expand on the idea by creating content

the middle part of development (the author called it the Swamp), it's a place where we tend to get the least amount of mental reward
* once you get there, your most recent memory is the excitement of the first phase, where new innovations are happening
* now gone, the slog has begun

then maybe you feel wrong, so you stop and start a new project
* or restart the same project over and over again

Inventors tend to front-load projects and start polishing very early on
* eg. having nice-looking prototypes, first levels, and/or "test arenas" laying around
* we can save more of those for later
	* so that we don't eat all of the metaphorical candy in the beginning

How? Focus on creating an outline or rough draft of the entire game as quickly as possible
* called an *alpha*
* focus on finishing the alpha first
* take breaks periodically to polish, experiment with mechanics, etc.
* to avoid restarting over
___

## Burrower

they burrow deep into a challenging technical problem, forgetting about the bigger picture
* eg. text box is one common tempting "hole" for coders
	* we need something that can get the text to display character-by-character and break properly between words
	* before long, we're making something that allows text to appear with different fonts, colors, speeds, etc.
	* sometimes we can see unfinished games that have only one or two levels but extremely nice text boxes
* eg. Pixel arts, likewise, offer limitless amounts of optimization

A lot of this work is justified as a way to speed up development in the future
* yes it can, but it also increases the overall scope of the game, generating extra works
* and if you got yourself one complex system, you'd expect that other parts in your game to have the same level of complexity

Like Inventors, Burrowers need to save some of the fun work for later and focus on reaching a rough draft, alpha version of the game as quickly as possible
* be ware that "good enough" is enough, and is better than perfect
	* even though some may find it hard to letting a problem go unsolved, even temporarily
* having good solutions is by all mean a good thing, but for the sake of the project as a whole, some compromises need to be made behind-the-scenes
* to avoid Rabbit Holes and Death Loops
___

## Wanderer
people that don't have a strong, singular skill or focused interest to lean on

they tend to keep searching for the "best" way to do things
* hoping that they'll be able to move forward once they have the best of everything
* but the "best" tools, algorithms, etc. are the ones that get the job done

it's hard for wanderers to find the motivation to overcome the obstacles
* a lack of motivation is common, and it's hard to diagnose
* if you do experience a lack of motivation, ask yourself, where is it come from?
	* is the basic, day-to-day work of game development not fun?
	* are you setting your expectations too high?
	* are you comparing your work to others?
	* are you just too tired, stressed, or anxious?

whatever the issue is, it rarely hurts to scale back on project scope and focus on personal growth as you figure it out
* ask yourself, what inspires you?
* how you can feel proud of your own progress, no matter how big or small the final product is
___

## Finisher

Finishing a game is a success in and of itself
* it feels good
* and the memory of that good feeling will help you move forward in the middle of development
	* after the initial excitement of starting the project has worn off
* so make that memory for yourself as quickly and as early as possible

Don't feel bad if you're struggling with finishing a game
* it's a skill, and it's a hard one
* also you may find that you would rather finish a game with someone else

Last but not least, Daydreamer, Inventor, Burrower, are valuable as well.
* although it seems Finisher is in shorter supply
	* maybe due to the nature of creatives to struggle with finding an end to creating
___

# Death Loops

many indie game developers can fall into traps that either prevent them from finishing their projects or extend the length of the development to a point where there is tremendous pressure for the game to succeed

> [!quote]
> Finishing games gets easier with each game you finish, and the more games you finish, the better you will understand what it takes to make a successful game.

Developers need to finish their first few games in a timely fashion in preparation for a long and healthy career
___

## The Loop Of Restarting

![looprestart.jpg (768×448) (derekyu.com)](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/images/deathloops/looprestart.jpg)

eg.
* the devs would continuously remake their first few levels
* the sprites would be redone to look nicer
* the base code would get rewritten to allow for more intricate mechanics
* new content would get added, like fancier combat systems or an overworld map

These were never part of the original plan
* they expanded the projects laterally, instead of moving them forward

Your skills are always improving
There are always new tools for your game
New games will release during your development, adding extra pressure to "keep up" and staty competitive

These temptations never go away. There will always be a better way to do it, a better tool, a better design. At some point you either learn to live with it and release your game or simply stay in the loop forever.


### Breaking Out

**Learn how to properly scope**
* The best metric for scoping a project is not what technical skills you have, but the scope of the previous games you've finished

**Save most of the polishing for the end**
* it's best not to spend too long on any one part of the game until the entire game is playable from beginning to end
	* this is the suggested way to create almost anything
	* eg. to write a story you start with an outline and then a rough draft
	* eg. to paint a painting you start with a sketch
* that way you can see your creation as a whole and it will give you a better sense of what you need to do to finish
* also, once you put your brain into polish mode it can be hard to return to sketch mode

**Look beyond this one game**
* this one game you're making is part of a long chain of games
* it won't be your only chance to make a game
	* you can even make the same game a second time
* so abandon the goal of making an objectively great game
* instead, focus on making the best game you can at the time
	* and find joy in your personal growth

**Get hooked on the deeper satisfaction of finishing games**
* if you want to start over so badly, it's ok
* but start an entirely new project with a much smaller scale
___

## The Loop Of Polishing

![looppolish.jpg (768×500) (derekyu.com)](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/images/deathloops/looppolish.jpg)

what is "polish"?
* smaller improvements that can be critical, but are not truly essential

it's vague, so it's hard to plan around, and it's hard to know when to stop adding polish
* but do note that, you can never finish polishing
	* "A work of art is never finished, only abandoned."
* the more complex of games, the more places where polish could potentially be added

and we can get trapped in *sunk cost fallacy*
* the idea that what you've already invested in the project, justifies sinking more time into it
* the longer a game is in development, the more you feel like it has to succeed to justify its development time, which causes you to spend even more development time on it

and maybe we actually don't want to release?


### Breaking Out

**Understand how polish benefits your game**
* polish is not a great way to make your game more appealing
	* the core concept and basic execution are much more important
	* eg. if the overall art style of your game is unappealing, adding juicy effects and other little details will probably not translate into more sales
	* "a mud pie won't taste good no matter how much frosting you put on it"
* although, some games are based heavily around a polished aesthetic and experience
	* so polish matters more for these games
* so, not every polish is important, although some are
	* decide what to polish consciously
	* a deadline probably can help here

**Learn how to analyze feedback properly**
* "Don't read the comments" is a comon refrain
	* because they can get ugly
* although unfortunately, it's where we'll find the clearest insight into how well our game is going to do
* so, again, be conscious about what changes to make
	* evaluate do the changes worth it
___

## Conclusion

from 1985 to 1988, Nintendo released four Super Mario titles
* each generation is a big improvement
* they didn't made it halfway through SMB1's development and decided to start over to make SMB2, or tried to go straight to a game of SMB3's scale
* if they did, what you think the overall outcome would be? is it better or worse?

![smb.png (768×500) (derekyu.com)](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/images/deathloops/smb.png)

yes we are in the 2020s now, it's a different era
but the point is, we should work our way up through steady and consistent releases rather than one long and self-destructive longshot

it's healthier to have projects in a short timeframe
___

# Assessing Risk

In many ways, risk is used to the indie creator's advantage
* we can make games with themes, mechanics, and aesthetics that big budget studios can't or won't consider

It's critical that we look beyond the "breakout" hits, and also consider the qualities of games that succeed quietly, methodically, and on a smaller scale
* don't just look at the big "overnight success"
* because it could have easily been built on the tail of a hundred lesser-known releases
	* or with extra resources that reduced the risk of failure
* we should also make sure we recognize that less risky games still contain important innovations to the artform

so, how risky is a game concept?
* how can you predict the outcome of your work?
* note that here we're talking about financial risk
	* here we defined success as making a sustainable living from selling games
___

## Background

a common risk is that a developer pushed through to the bitter end of development, only to realize that there isn't a large enough audience to justify another game
* don't do this
* don't blindly follow a notion and hope for the best

you should know and estimate the risk, and we have a framework for that,
it has two major components: **Resource Investment** and **Broad Appeal**

Resource Investment
* what you put into the project
	* eg. time, money, etc.
* the more you put in, the more you'll probably need to get back to call it a "success"
* the length and difficulty of our path

Broad Appeal
* how appealing is the project to the broad audience
	* how large is the potential audience
* the reward at the end of our path

eg. A game that requires less investment but is broadly appealing, is low risk
eg. A game that requires more investment but is not broadly appealing, is high risk

![risk.jpg (1080×900) (derekyu.com)](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/images/risk/risk.jpg)

Therefore, if you want to have a lower risk, you could consider either
* lowering amount of resources you invest into the project
* increasing the broad appeal of your game

Then, here's the tricky part: how is it possible to increase the broad appeal of a game without investing proportionally more resources into it?
* well, indie developers do it all the time
	* so figuring that out is a key part of being indie
* big budget studios obviously try to work efficiently too, so they will do the same
	* but by their nature they will miss any ideas that are not in the extreme upper-right part of the graph
* however, you can't get part as well because small developers don't have that many resources
___

## Resource Investment

The threshold for success goes up the more resources you invest your game
* if "successful" means let you keep going

Certain concepts and genres require more resources than others
* eg. an MMORPG would require a massive investment and is a huge risk in that regard
* but how much time and money is required to make a roguelike compared to a puzzler?

**Unique Content**
* one thing to consider is the amount of unique content your game requires
* the more one-off, non-reusable content you'll have to make, the more time it will take to make it
* more unique content doesn't means more risk necessarily
	* the larger resource investment was balanced by the game's enormous appeal

**Experimentation Required**
* another thing to consider is the amount of experimentation required to make you game fun
	* how often will you have to "go back to the drawing board" when an idea doesn't pan out?
	* the more novel your core game mechanics are, the more time it will take to get them right
* Exciting and novel ideas are often hard to systemize
	* eg. successful puzzle game are usually based around high concept ideas and it takes a lot of experimentation with design and technology to find the depth in their mechanics
		* eg. Braid, Portal, or Antichamber
* some games are not easy to imagine how they'd work in practice, until you play those games yourself, so these games are quite resource-intensive
	* eg. puzzlers are in this club

**Developer Experience**
* the less experience you have with the type of game you're making, the more experimentation will be required
* if you're not familiar with a certain type of game, expect that you'd need to put more resources into it
___

## Broad Appeal

note that "broadly appealing" only means some certain things appeal to a large number of people
* not necessarily means that's "good" or "worthwhile"
* as a new indie dev, you might want to focus more on broadly-appealling concepts
	* because you don't have many resources and you can't take high risk

also note that no one can predict with 100% certainty what will be popular
* but we can learn from the success of individual games and the evolution of games as an artform, to develop a sense for what matters, on a fundamental level, to the average player
* and it's up to you how much you want to factor it into your own plans


### 1. "Bigness"

players are generally excited by the prospect of getting lost in large game worlds where there is a lot of variety and a lot of ways for them to express their own creativity
* there's a trend of virtual worlds getting larger
* games have also tried to give players more agency over time
	* moving from totally linear, level-based structures, to free exporation

but obviously not every successful game has a large open world, it doesn't matter that much any way, because player just want games to FEEL big
* game worlds don't need to BE big
* we can have a smaller game world, but players can visit it many times and in many different ways
	* eg. randomized level generation and build/run-based gameplay are good ways to make this "big" quality without resorting to large open worlds
	* another way is that we can add extra modes to put a different spin on static content
		* this one is less effective though because there is not that much variety

Compelling characters and lore may also generate a feeling that the game is larger than the sum of its parts
* we can give players a sense that what they interact with in-game is part of something larger
	* although what they see in-game might not be a lot
* if they're excited, they might fill in the blanks themselves

Online multiplayer can make even a tiny game feel big
* if enough people are playing it simultaneously
* however, if the playerbase is small, the game will feel just as small
* so even if you do have the resources and experience to implement it, use it wisely

often times when players complain about playtime is that they want more "bigness"
* and bigness is a multifaceted and wide-ranging concept that's difficult to think about
* but figuring out efficient and "out-of-the-box" solutions to the problem of "bigness", is one of the most important things we can do to be broadly appealling


### 2. Fiddliness

"Fiddliness" is a concept in boards games
* it's usually meant as a pejorative 貶義
	* like: "This game is too fiddly."

A fiddly board game has
* too many minor rules
* too many edge cases to remember
* too many different pieces that need to be moved around to track things
* In other word, a fiddly game is one that lacks elegance in design

It makes sense that fiddliness would be seen as a bad thing in tabletop games
* because elegance, the quality of having a few very intuitive, powerful rules, is how board games take the complexity out of rulekeeping so that players can focus on strategizing

But in video games, the computer can manage so much of the fiddliness for us
* an extra rule that causes headaches in a board game because it introduces a new chit to move around might go completely unnoticed in a video game
* as a result, video game players actually value fiddliness
	* because they get to play more, see more, do more, if a game has more details in its rules
* Fiddly genres like strategy/tactics games, simulations, and amnagement games are evergreen for this reason

Fiddliness is a contributor to bigness as well
* a small world that has a lot to do in it can feel bigger than a large world that is lacking in interactivity
* bigness and fiddliness are the key to understand how popular a genre is and how much room there is in the genre for more successful games

if we had to choose between an elegant-but-restrictive solution, and a janky-but-permissive solution, we'd lean toward picking the latter
* elegance is not much of a useful thing in game design
___

### 3. Technical Aspect


**Aesthetics**

author claimed, aesthetics have to be REALLY compelling before they start making a significant impact on a game's broad appeal
* so investing in arts is not much of a useful thing
* unless you invest very very much on arts to make sure it's really compelling

if you're not confident in your artistic skills, put more time and energy into bigness and fiddliness
* because they will count much more

a minimalist art style that is crisp and expressive will give back more for your efforts than one that is trying to emulate Cuphead or Metal Slug but falls short


**Novelty**

there is a divide between how players, game developers, and game journalists value novelty
* journalists and devs often times laud a unique new indie game concept
* but the same game ends up not selling very well because the game feels small and restrictive to players
* so novelty is not primary, bigness and fiddliness are

some ideas can be so one-of-a-kind and so interesting that they don't need to be big or fiddly
* that obviously is one risky strategy if you don't have the requisite experience
* "novel ideas" usually end up being gimmicky, ie. unique but also shallow/restrictive

so, try to find creative ways to put your personality in the details of your game
* players do feel your "soul" in the project if you did a good job of it
___

### 4. Marketing


**Reputation**

having a positive reputation increases the appeal of the games you release
* so it lowers your risk
* eventually, people might start to buy game partly for you, but not just for the game

And the media enjoys writing articles about "The New Game From the Creator of X"
* so it's easier for you to do marketing

Also, when evaluating other games in your research, you should keep in mind the effect that reputation is having on their success
* a well-known and popular developer shoulders less risk when working on a niche game
* and they may be able to make an idea seem appealing in a way that a new developer can't


**Price**

Simply put, lower price points are more appealing to players
and, for new indie developers in particular, it's more important to grow your fanbase than to maximize your revenue

more players means more reviews and more people talking about your game all at once,
and that's what will get the snowball rolling before it turns into a puddle
* the amount of work we put into developing our games is inconsequential to our potential fans
* pricing expectations and what the player values are all that matter when they are browsing a game store

but, if you price too low that can cast doubt on the quality of your work, so you want to make sure you're in a reasonable range of prices
* to know your price range, compare your game to others
* as a new developer, you may want to be looking more at the lower end of the price range
	* with the aim of maximizing community growth, number of positive reviews, and word-of-mouth marketing


**Marketing**

marketing can help, but in a sense that it's a multiplayer
* a game that isn't broadly appealing likely won't become broadly appealing through marketing
* there is only so much that marketing can help

It also takes resources to implement
* and that resources could be spent on developing the game

So, with marketing, maybe it's better to focus on the lowest-hanging fruit,
marketing that you can do from your computer
* create appealing screenshots
* create appealing trailers
	* skillful trailer editors are worth it if you can afford one
* create appealing store pages
* give out codes to reviewers and streamers and post about your game on social media when inspiration strikes

These are perfectly solid foundation for marketing
* you can feel good if you can manage all that and nothing more

Marketing also is the best way to get a direct sense of your game's appeal before release
___

## Summary: It's Prioritizing

"Risk assessment" is just another way of saying, "my time is limited, so where is it best spent?"
* think about What you put in? and What you get back?

It also explains why it can feel so bad when we compare ourselves to one another in the indie dev community - a game that took one year to make can wildly outperform a game that took ten years
* because the former was made using simpler processes with more broadly appealing outcomes

Like how finishing is a skill, finding the intersection between what you like and what others like is also a skill. Spending your time wisely is a skill, too.
* learn the risks, so you can develop those skills
___
