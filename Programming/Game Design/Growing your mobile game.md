# What is Monetization?

*Monetization* refers to a set of strategies and tactics which developers and publishers can use to generate revenue from their apps.

Like in business, it's not good practice to risk placing all your resources in one single deal.
* the more diverse your source of income, the less risky your venture

If you're just starting out, all these monetization possibilities may feel a bit overwhelming
* but it's important to explore various approaches
* so that you can understand what is right for your game
___

# What is User Acquisition?
often shortened to UA

a healthy game business has
* large enough player base
* the ability to acquire the right users and keep them engaged

UA refers to gaining new users for an app, platform, or service
* on mobile, it generally means generating installs
* typically achieved through advertising or promotions

it's important to acquire users who are valuable and are going to stay engaged in our game
* so that we have more opportunities to monetize those users with either ads or in-app purchases
___

# Lifetime value

both acquiring valuable users and engaging players are important
* so that players wish to continue playing our game for a lifetime

we want to increase the lifetime value of current users
meanwhile we want to keep adding more potential high value users, through both paid and organic tactics
___

# Advertising Ecosystem

It can be broken down into *supply* and *demand*
* supply is the opportunity to sell the ads
	* publishers or developers
	* the game, in other word the ad space
* demand is the opportunity to buy that ad space and show the adverts
	* advertisers

eg. we can **sell** ads within out game
eg. we can **buy** ad space, maybe in order to show our game ads and hopefully get installs
___

## Traditional advertising

eg. newspaper, magazine, website
* one to one relationship
	* one ad space for one potential advertisers

* hard to scale
	* need many sales people to find advertisers
___

## Ad networks

one to many relationship
* inventory, the ad space, can be set up for many advertisers to be able to buy

publishers can set up rules and guidelines of what kind of ads they are willing to accept
* eg. a game that's targeting children may block ads with certain content
* the ad technology will help determine what ad to serve
	* so we don't need to decide on an ad by ad basis
___

# Monetization Ethics
There are many bad ads, but they fund "free content"

it's up to the developer to ensure that monetization activities or touchpoints are native to the user's experience
* so that players are engaged with relevant content both within ads and gameplay

Why is advertising necessary and ethical?
* enable developers and content creators to build a sustainable business that scales

How can advertising be used unethically?
* middlemen reselling user data without permission
* advertisers misrepresenting their product or service in an ad
* content owners implementing ads in a way that generates many accidental clicks or taps in order to artificially inflate revenue

Regulators and technology platforms are continually improving and enforcing purity in ad ecosystems, in order to reward the good players and eradicate the bad players
