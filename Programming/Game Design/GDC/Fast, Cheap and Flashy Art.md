# Tooth And Tail

it's a strategy game for people who think they don't like strategy game
* so it's meant to be really approachable

for a very long time, their art style was Starcraft meets Mario Kart
* the initial art is terrible

> Games look terrible until they look great.

but it's like 18 months of development
* they were considered that crappy art is what they would ship
* although the game surely is fun, the art is a barrier that stopped players and press from ever discovering that
* so 18 months later, they finally got a dedicated art person to help righting this ship

there are limitations
* basically no money, because they are already spent
* the deadline is close, about 10 months

## Art fundamentals for games

if the art was bad, why it's bad?
* it comes down to art fundamentals
* they weren't being used to communicate important information to the players


### value
how bright or dark is something

if something is important, surely it deserves a higher contrast
* at least, player has to stand out from other random things like the terrain


### color

1. we should make use of complementary colors
* eg. there is a joke that all movie posters are in blue and orange
* but it works

2. we can make contrast in the color saturations
* eg. characters can be more saturated than the terrain, instead of using rather dark and desaturated colors, resulting a little subdued and sleepy mood


### character design

don't make it overly complex
