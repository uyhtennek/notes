[Marketing Fundamentals for New Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5tyX_IBTXA)

"I don't need marketing, a great game will sell itself."
But, marketing works actually like a multiplier, so every game needs marketing
* at least if the game is supposed to be big

"Luck is a major factor in gmae sales."
* clearly imply a lack of understanding about value

"I did everything right. I had a great game, good reviews, good press, and I went to all the events. If I failed it had to have been the macro economic state of indie games (for sure not me)."
* it shows the person don't have an understanding about where funding is coming from
___

# Conversion System
it's a mindset that we have to be in to understand how everything fits together

**Cost**
can be labor, time, money, community, even moral (people can burnt out)

**Views**
* curated views, coming from like press
* adverts, views that we pay for
* community
	* this is actually the hardest one to get, and the most expensive one
	* hardest to control as well
	* so focusing towards community tends to be a very bad idea
		* unless we have some very good metrics telling us that we should

**Engagement Rate**
the number of people who have viewed the game and care about the game, and then take action to get more information about the game
* no matter what, a percentage of the views are always going to turn into an engagement rate
	* it's just kind of how life works, there will always be some person who just loves it
		* for some reason
		* even if the game is garbage

**Conversion Rate**
it's gonna be some percent of engagement rate, that turn into some kind of value in the future.
* can be sales and money, directly
* can be someone buying your T-shirt
* can be someone going to your community or going to Twitter
	* Tweeting you or retweeting your stuff
* sending you a little box of cookies

**Value Returned**
it only counts if it's captured! measurement is required.
* if you get a news article, a giant press release, and you don't do anything with it, don't put it somewhere in a way that keeps people together, it will decay and die very quickly
___

# Mailing Lists
because this one is minimal

* Low effort required to set up
* Don't need a finished game to use
* Don't need much to maintain it
* Universally provides value
	* we can cash out on it
* can gauge value right away even when we're not selling a game
___

# Measurement
how to record everything? and the tools for that.

**Cost**
* get a notebook
* just keep track of where you're putting up money and who you're putting up money with
* same idea applies to recording time spent

**Views**
* Twitter, Facebook, YouTube Analytics
* SEMRush, Alexa
	* they are metrics that gauge how much activity is going to a website
	* helps us figuring out whether or not that press release that we put together, that exclusive interview was actually going to be something that pays off in the future
* because we need to know how many views we're getting from a big media place
	* so that we know if what we put in, is worth more or less than what we get out

**Engagement Rate**
* Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Clicky
* they measure how many people land on our web page
	* how many people who viewed the thing and actually went over and saw our stuff
* Clicky helps telling us where the people are directly coming from

**Conversion Rate**
people viewed our thing, landed on our web page, then how many registered for the mailing list?
* To set up a mailing list, check out Sendy, MailChimp, Awebber, Infusionsoft
	* Sendy is probably the best for new developers

**Value Returned**
this is tricky to measure, how do we measure, people?
* Cohort Analysis
	* it is just a term for the idea that "people in big group can be separated into smaller groups"
* most people just sign up for the mailing list, and then just leave
	* for some reason, they just signed up, and for some reason, they never read the e-mail
* eventually that leave us with a core group of people, that actually read our e-mails
	* how do we know the number of that will not go down suddenly?
	* it's just what human do. If we go through a lot of hoops with somebody, pass a lot of barriers, go very far, it tends to be that we value the person or the thing very much.
* if the number does drop, we were likely creating content that they don't care about, or failing them for some reason although we were given a chance
___

# Example

eg. Should I get a booth?
* Cost, maybe $10,000
	* we're going to fly out, buy booth, book hotel rooms, do the set up, ....
* Views, actually we kind of don't care about the views that we get from an event
	* because we try to predict that beforehand, before deciding to go to the event or not
	* we do that by run a press release prior to the event
		* basically, never go to an event, unless you've already put out something somewhere
* Engagement Rate, again, we don't care how many people will engage after visiting our booth that much, but we care about that rate after we have the press release prior to the event
	* make sure the contents are all set and all clear though
	* when you get a press release, you don't want people who go to your website, only to know it is crashed and downed and they get none other information
* Conversation Rate, again, all the measurement doesn't happen on the booth
* Value Returned, now we have our estimated number, then we can do a little algebra
	* like $(V_{in} \times E \times C) \times V_{out} = 10,000$
	* then we can figure out how many views we need, in order to profit from the cost

Then, the question becomes, How much press writes ups would I need?
but then How can I be certain that many will write?
* simply just talk to them
* email many many people
	* before the event, look at who is going to attend, message them to sell them on the game
	* in a month in advance
* when the event comes, but the number is not looking good, just don't go, just cancel
	* maybe before the deadline for dropping out the event

eg. When should I launch my game / kickstarter?
just ran the conversion system, til it outputted you can succeed exactly on day one
* just don't launch until it says to

for the kickstarter part
* before launching, get all the views you can get from mailing list and press releases, trailers, etc.
* it doesn't stop after launch, we can bomb the mailing list
	* saying things like "hey, we're doing a exclusive PC gaming review, go check it out!"
	* then all these users come over to PC gaming and bomb its comments
	* that create a lot of engagements, people are sharing it, and wanting to see the next trailer
	* then it snowballs
___

# It's not perfect
but it's good, hopefully good enough

it's a mental map that often lead even inexperienced developers to good conclusions
* eg. we need enough press releases and writers, before we go for an event or an interview
* even the data that we're putting into the system is inaccurate, the output is close
	* hopefully good enough

if we don't have the system solved, or be reasonable, something is not right
* often times we perceive things as reasonable, if the system tells the opposite, it's the opposite
___

# more

how to get people to sign up for the mailing list?
* since they want to filter only the optimal people for the mailing list, they put the access in the very end of their game

how to connect with press release?
* just say hello, although it's weird
* for the content, just something like "here is a GIF of my game, what do you think?" kind of stuff
* connect with many writers or influencers, so you know what type of games they are interested
	* then you know who to message, given the type of your game

Twitter and Facebook, tends to be bad for engagement
* it's talking within a circle, and tweets or posts expire very quickly
* so, you can do Twitter, but for fun, don't devote hours to it

* getting press interested, is a better solution, probably the best
	* actually the best is forming personal relationship
* then adverts start to have some use
* you'll find one of the two thousand websites interested
	* some are in Spanish, some are in French, ...
	* talk to all of them, figure out how they are
* although it seems devoting too much resources to marketing
	* like the time to talk to all the press
	* it's not avoidable, as marketing is a multiplier
