Many programmers did not meet the minimum bar for their job.

# Programmer Test
count how many you answer yes to.

I can articulate (= express) precisely what problem I am trying to solve.
No.
* if you write code or change code, but other can't understand, it is just noise to the team

I have articulated precisely what problem I am trying to solve.
No.
* same as above

I have confirmed that someone else can articulate what problem I am trying to solve.
....
* simple common mistake in communication, of not confirming

I can articulate why my problem is important to solve.
No.
* Is the problem you are solving matters?
* Don't waste time on things that actually have no value.

I can articulate how much my problem is worth solving.
No.
* How long should I spend on this thing?
	* as long as it takes. Then you're screwed.
	* no problem is worth infinite time
* similarly, how much manpower, how much effort?
* What are the limits?
* you should put some boundary on the value of this problem

I have a Plan B in case my solution to my current problem doesn't work.
* so something fall apart, but you don't have a Plan B
	* you then scramb to try to figure things out and fix them, at the same time blaming everybody else, blaming the project management or someone
* but the thing is, you knew the deadline was coming, you knew there was potential risks
	* yet, you don't have a Plan B in advance
* that's a problem on you

I have already implemented my Plan B in case my solution to my current problem doesn't work.
* same as above
* once there is a safety net, and everybody can be confident
	* on the opposite, if you implement the Plan B in the last minute, everyone is stressed
	* because they don't know if your Plan B is going to work
* sometimes, half the times, if you try the Plan B up front, you might discover that is good enough
	* it does its job, maybe Plan A is not needed
	* or, you discover problems that you didn't anticipate (= think of) at all
		* you may discover Plan A is actually not going to work
	* so put your Plan B in first

I can articulate the steps required to solve my current problem.
Yes.
* surely you need to know the steps to solve a problem to solve a problem

I can clearly articulate unknowns and risks associated with my current problem.
No.
* when you do your estimates, do they have any value?
* what are the things that you don't know?
	* the things that you need to study, that you need to test.
* if you can't articulate that, you can't give a reasonable estimate

I have not thought or said "I can just make up the time" without immediately talking to someone.
No.
* so you have something due to be delivered in the next day or days, but something else drops on your lap, maybe some bugs, or whatever
	* then you think, "ah... okay I can make up the time"
	* then you didn't make up the time
* people go "where is my thing?", and you go "this thing is messing with me."
	* but you knew that, yet you didn't tell to anyone
	* no surprise they are surprised

I write a "framework" and have used it multiple times to actually solve a problem it was intended to solve.
No.
* so you have some utility scripts around, but you didn't verify it, didn't prove that it's working
	* you expect and wait for somebody else to do that
* then how anybody else is supposed to trust it?

I can articulate the test for completion of my current problem is.
....
* How do I know when it is done?
* The program needs to be faster. It is faster. But how much is it faster?
	* Essentially, does it cross the passing line?
	* How enough is enough?

I can articulate the hypothesis related to my problem and how I could falsify it.
No.
* so you are trying to implement a feature. you actually have a hypothesis that this feature is somehow relevant, maybe the game is more fun because of it.
* you're only looking at the positive number.
	* you think the feature is relevant
	* but have you think of how you could prove it's wrong?
* that's the scientific method. you need to look for how you could prove something is wrong.
	* if you haven't thought about how your hypothesis could be proved wrong, you're doing it wrong.

I can articulate the (various) latency requirements for my current problem.
* When people need the problem be solved?
	* I don't know, right now?
	* Right now is not a good answer. That is immediate latency for all the things.
* Some problems can be solved later, some need to be solved in the next possible step.

I can articulate the (various) throughput 吞吐量 requirements for my current problem.
* How much things the system need to handle at the same time?

I can articulate the most common concrete use case of the system I am developing.
* even if your system is perfect enough to handle all use cases
* but what is the most common use case?
	* you should develop the APIs, or the system, around that common use case
	* but not any other use case

I know the most common actual, real-life values of the data I am transforming.
* What is the data you're looking at?
	* Idk, could be anything.
* It can't be anything.
	* Some actual values, some real-life values, are actually coming through here. What are they?

I know the acceptable ranges of values of all the data I am transforming.
* "You can do anything with it."
* Well, you can't. Nothing, at least none motal thing, can handle infinity.
	* an int is only 32 bits

I can articulate what will happen when (somehow) data outside that range enters the system.
* it's inevitable. it's going to happen.
* so what will happen? do you know?
	* if you don't know, you should know.
* developing based on hoping that it will never happen, is not good engineering practice

I can articulate a list of input data into my system roughly sorted by likelihood.
* so you can articulate the data, but can you sort them or categorize them?
* so that you can solve starting from the most common thing, then the next most common thing.

I know the frequency of change of the actual, real-life values of the data I am transforming.
* if something can only change once per second, it's no need to calculate that once per frame.

I have (at least partially) read the (available) documentation for the hardware, platform, and tools I use most commonly.
~~Yes.~~ No.
* if you can, crack the manual.
	* learn assembly instructions?

I have sat and watched an actual user of my system?
No.

I know the slowest part of the users of my system's workflow with high confidence.
* so that you can improve the workflow

I know what information users of my system will need to make effective use of the solution.
* if the artists have no profiling information, how you are expecting them to optimize your system?

I can articulate the finite set of hardware I am designing my solution to work for.
* what hardware is the system supposed to work on?

I can articulate how that set of hardware specifically affects the design of my system.

I have recently profiled the performance of my system.
* recently being the keyword

.......

I can schedule my own time well.
* you're an adult

I am vigilant about not wasting others' time.
* if you can look something up in five seconds on Google, why bother others?
* if you spent two weeks futzing with a problem, when there is somebody on your team can solve it in five minutes, you're wasting their time because they're going to help you catch up.
* so if something takes you some minutes, ask for help.

I actively seek constructive feedback and take it seriously.

I am not actively avoiding any uncomfortable (professional) conversations.
* if there is something wrong, tell others.

I am not actively avoiding any (professional) conflicts.
* if there is something wrong, tell others, even if it causes conflicts.

I consistently interact with other professionals, professionally.
* just be polite, be professional

I can articulate what I believe others should expect from me.
* a lot of people are waiting for other people to tell them what the expectations are. so here it is.
* how about, you tell me, what should I expect from you?

I do not require multiple reminders to respond to a request or complete work.
* you are an adult. don't wait for somebody else to poke you.
* just get your job done.

I pursue opportunities to return value to the commons (when appropriate).
* you're here, because some other people gave you some opportunity
* so give value back

I actively work to bring value to the people I work with.
* you're part of a team. have you bring value to the team?
* where can you help them?
* where can you teach them?
* where can you learn from them?
* how do you interact with your team?

I actively work to ensure underrepresented voices are heard.
* don't get into the old pipeline problem, so no shit like "it's not my problem"
* do something
	* if somebody in the room, make sure that they're heard
___

They are the minimum.
If any No do any of the statement, you're not good enough.
