* goal: really concrete useable creativity
	* focus on coming up with new game ideas

# What is creativity?
it isn't the muses descending from the heavens....

Creativity tends to arise
* out of scenes
* out of the clash, collision, mixing together of disparate ideas
	* from different cultures or subcultures or disciplines

> [!quote]
> Creativity is what happens when you take oil and water and actually try to mix them.

It actually is a fairly straightforward process
* that we can cause to happen, quite intentionally
* so it's a skill set that we can actually practice and develop into a habit

* also person expression isn't necessarily creative
___

# Substrate
the most boring part of setting up an aquarium (水族箱)
* but without it, all the awesome colorful fishes above it can't live

What a game is?
* just for a moment, consider the idea that first-person shooter and poker are the same thing
	* they are, a game
* a game is, a set of rules
	* a set of behaviors, rules, resources, and that kind of things, that interact with one another

Change its presentation or content, then it's a *reskin* or *clone*
* The Lord of the Ring chess is still chess

Change **one** of its rules, then it's a *variant*
* it opens up the door to new styles of play, but the game is still pretty much the same

Change more of its rules, we end up with a *family*

Eventually, a *genre* is what encapsulates all of above

| herarchy | example 1 | example 2 | workshop |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| game | Straight poker | Castle Wolfenstein | Donkey Kong |
| reskin | | Spear of Destiny | Donky Kong Jr. |
| variant | Wild cards | Doom | Kangaroo |
| family | Stud poker | Deathmatch | 2D platformer |
| genre | Poker | First person shooters | 2D platformer |

the original Poker
* has less cards
* has only one round
	* we just drew

Then gradually variants started coming in
And now when we say Poker, most people actually think of for example Texas Hold'em
* it is a very specific variant within the Poker family
* but they all are, still, poker
	* there's something there that make us say this is all in common


## Variant

Almost every video game we make, is actually a variant
* truly new games are incredibly rare
* the tabletop game industry is the very opposite though
	* every German board game is actually significantly different
* if we do see a significant creative innovation in video game mechanics
	* it tends to be at the casual game end and the abstract end of the spectrum

* indie games and mobile games tends to be more innovative
	* because innovation is often very expensive and highly risky
	* so budgets, cost of entry, cost of failure, must be low
* so we're actually in an amazing period of new mechanics being invented
	* of creativity in the industry
* as budgets rise, it is expected to see less creativity in the industry actually
___

# Atomization
and abstraction

it is a weird skill to have though
* we often tend to look more the game surface, than at the mathematics underneath

the things is, going back to the simple games of the 70s, 80s is super valuable
* things focus a lot on the casual end of the spectrum
* because they work at the large scale as well
	* because we can plug in the mechanics of a small casual game, to a game with a larger scale

So, if you're a game designer
* obsessively play lots of board games
* obsessively play lots of mobile games
* get yourself a MAME cabinet, and play the games in chronological order


## Seeing systems

we have 4 separate piles of cards
* every pile has an ace in it
* the rest of the cards are random
* you flip cards, start with the first pile, any time you flipped an ace, you go to the next pile

Do you think this game is fun?
* this was game of the year 2013

how come this mechanic is game of the year?
* this mechanic here, is environmental storytelling
	* you find hotspots in an environment, and at some point it unlocks more hotspots

Learning to see things this way, abstractly, is an enormous help
* it helps you build a library, a library of patterns, or game mechanics patterns
* eg. Set packing, Time limits, Guessing, Pickups, Exponentially, Hidden information, ......

Often times we can find these are isomorphic to one another
* it means sometimes the same mechanic can be described using completely different words
* eg. we can see Sudoku as a fill-the-map problem, or a set packing problem
	* those are different branches of mathematics, but they both can solve the same problem

## Readings

* Game Design Patterns
* Advanced Game Mechanics
both are books

Learn mechanics like these as many as you can
* because these are the tools on our workbench
___

# Context replacement
Nobody ever comes up with something just out of the blue

Creativity is taking a pattern out of its context and moving it into a different one
* there was a glass maker in Venice, who wanted to make clear glass
	* because he imported a plant from Turkey, and then mixed the ashes for the plant into the glass and somehow that made it clear
* somebody else go "if we then grind these, we could make lenses", then they invented spectacles
* but then it took a long time to pull that out into a different context, and invent microscopes and telescope
* and then it took a very long time to put that into another context, and invent fiber optics

So moving a very simple idea from place to place and context to context, and changing it in the process is actually the biggest tool for creativity
* it's the reason why scenes work
	* disparate groups of people coming together in an environment in order to bounce ideas off of each other
* it's why non-homogeneous teams tend to be more creative
	* than homogeneous teams or teams that have worked together for a very long time


## eg. Die

We're all familiar with dice being a *probability* device
* it generates a random number from 1 to 6

But if we have a die, and we're not allow to use it as a random number generator
* so we can't roll the die, then how can we use it?
* eg. as a hit point counter, as a timer, as an indicator of state, as an indicator of max value, etc.
* eg. a tabletop game "blueprints", used dice as building bricks

If we pull a simple tool out of its context, out of its assumptions, then move it to some places else, then suddenly we might get a whole new fresh set of ideas
* this is why if we're playing with cards and using cards for a prototyping tool, it is valuable to have a regular kind of deck, and an UNO deck, although mathematically they are identical
	* because they look so different, that it pushes us in different directions
___

# Add a statistic
the simplest (perhaps saddest) means of innovation

we're talking about new stat that can lead to new rule
* eg. time limit, number of moves, attack strength rating, etc.

removing a statistic or verb can often be interesting too
___

# Change a dimension

There have only been 5 fighting games

| Fighting game | Moves | Movement |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| Rock paper scissors | 3 attacks | None |
| Karate Champ | 13 attacks, 4 defense | 2D axis |
| Karateka | 6 attacks, 2 stances, bow | Side scrolling |
| Battle Arena Toshinden | > 50 attacks, 2 stances | 2 independent 2D axes |
| Bushido Blade | 8 weapons, 3 stances, many moves | 2D plane |

Why there is no Street Fighter, Tekken, etc.?
* they are just Karate Champ, but added statistic
	* more attacks, more defenses

Why there is no 3D fighting games?
* 3D is an narrative thing, an optical illusion
* the gameplay is 2D
___

# Analog Tools

think analog rather than digital
* game mechanics are rules after all, so we can break them down to very raw pieces
* that we can build and prototype using analog tools

* it forces us to step back and look at games that we're very familiar
	* and make it unfamiliar to us again
* this is actually a very classic technique
	* the history of creativity is littered with people getting stoned in various ways.....
___

# Force constraints
a time-honored classive creative tool
* poetry is full of working with constraints, on purpose

artists do gestural drawing
* "here's a gorgeous still-life construction of stuffs that you should draw. you have 7 seconds. go."
* it forces us to stop looking at it familiarly, by imposing a constraint, a time constraint in this case

You give yourself an impossible limit
* something that makes you go, "there's no way to do that!"
* then you'll probably start coming up with solutions
___

# Add a goal

great games tend to have, more than one goal operating at the moment-to-moment
* goal 1: cause damage
* goal 2: not take damage

In particularly, goals should be in competition with one another
* if you attack to cause damage, you can't defend to avoid damage
* goals that make you go, "oh crap, should I do A or B!?"
	* force the player to make decision, moment-to-moment

be careful of adding goals though
* players can't juggle too many at once
* since we have disparate goals, we need to balance them

if you have a multiplayer environment though, adding goals per role, is actually super critical
* the goal of a goalie and a striker is radically different
___

# Input mappings

we often neglect input as a part of a game
* but playing a game with different input methods, can feel very different
___

# Change topologies

a lot of game evolution is driven simply by changing the shape of the graph
___

# A meets B

Breakout and Space Invader are kinda similar
* so, actually, we can mix them

even for things, that don't seem like they have anything in common
* eg. Blackjack meets Robotron
* if they do share enough in common, it can work
___

# Simulate oddly

Could you do an RTS where you don't have a map?
* maybe simulate a RTS with just cards

The goal here, is not simulating the same thing, but to find different ways to enact the relationships between things

Could you simulate a first person shooter, with only dice?
___

# Change Metaphor

if we take a first person shooter and say it's about cameras
* then we suddenly can have depth of views, rule of thirds, composition, ..., in the game

Pac-Man, Miner 2049er, Bristles, Q\*Bert are kind of the same
___

# Merge mechanics

eg. we have Pac-man, but what if we want it to only visit some certain points?
* and what if we want the points to be hidden?
___

# Creativity in Art

when it comes to coming up with narrative or arts for a game, there is a common mistake
* we picked really boring familiar experiences to model

A vast majority of games are about, is just becoming more powerful, and nothing else
* which isn't a really innovative or interesting idea

So we need to ask questions, on a slightly deeper level
* eg. films that are about a badass hero, are very rarely about being a badass hero
	* eg. "Die Hard" is about a man trying to reconnect with his estranged wife


## Experience first

you have something that you want to say, and start building the game on that
* this is actually a very common approach

the risk here is, you then drill down into the same mechanics as always
* odds are, if you do, you're gonna undermine the point you were trying to make
	* because the mechanics that you'll be using, probably map to other things in people's minds already

if you want to be successful at getting across a point,
you want to find mechanics that cleave closely to the same point

the first step to this, is ask "is there a story that literally hasn't been told?"
* there are, in fact, many untold or unusual stories
	* perhaps the easiest ones to think of are, personal experience


## System first

you have a new rule set now, then ask yourself, "what does this mechanic means?"
* does it imply teamwork?
* does it imply persuasion?
* does it imply radicalization?

eg. we have 2 units, that can only successfully move, when they are near each other and linked
* maybe this game is about friendship?
* then ask yourself, "what is the system in the game, in which friendship is a key ingredient?"


## The Middle

at some point, we can start converging the theme and the system
* eg. what is a story that I could tell, that fits the mechanic, friendship?
	* maybe I need to use the mechanic in the game, where my parent teaches me to ride a bike

the thing is,
* in AAA studio, they tend to come at things, just from the theme,
* then in the casual puzzle kind of end, they tend to come at things, only from the system
	* then slap whatever skin they want
* but really interesting innovation is probably going to innovate on both levels at the same time

fun fact, romance novels are like down to a science now
* they know exactly the steps, the plots, to have

> [!tip] Romance Novels
> The core thing about romance novels is that, 2 people who have flaws, and the other person helps them overcome them. They're about, the gift of completion.

Then, what a mechanics of a "romance game" should be like?
* one need to be gifting resources to the other, without knowing how many the other have
* then what is the resources? (back to the theme)
	* confidence, independence, commitment, ....
	* because those are the typical themes of romance novels
* then we'd move back down to the system again, and so on
___

# Life habits
we're talking about life more than games now

Creativity is a skill, so it needs to be a habit as well
* visit [AGameAWeek](https://agameaweek.com/)
	* the guy puts out a new unique game a week
* like working songwriters try to write a song every day
	* they throw away amlost all of them

Be messy
* a disordered environment forces us to make unique connections
	* recall creativity is about making unusal connections between things
* also, 70dB of noise helps us generating ideas
	* [Coffitivity](https://coffitivity.com/) for coffee shop noise

Exercise
* stand-up at least once every hour, that kind of thing
* only exercises that can let your mind wander can help though

Sleep
* your smartphone has a sleep tracker

Take notes
* By hand
	* research study shows retention is better when you take notes by hand
* or tablet and stylus

Take risks
* don't be afraid to completely fail and fall on your face
* the classic way of doing brainstorm is, to say every idea is good, nobody criticized anybody
	* this is bad. it outputs 2 ideas per person per hour
* if you have other people in the room to say, "no. that's a bad idea. and here's why."
	* output is 7 ideas per person per hour
* it is incredibly important to be okay with failure, and keep those failures around
	* failures can turn around, to be really good ideas

Positive mood works better
* exercise and relax works. high-stress is a creativity killer.

Play the movie to yourself in your head
* this is a classic creative exercise
* try to close your eyes, then visualize a wheelbarrow
	* it is about diving into detail
	* more creative people usually "see more"

Read voraciously
* the world is full of systems and relationships, so read like crazy
* fun fact, AI in the early MMOs was partically inspired by the fact that at MIT that they were putting little robots on rollerskates
* Ideas come from funny places
	* read about every subject that you can think of
	* then you can start making connections that come out of context

Avoid homogeneity
* don't settle for the familiar
* don't settle for it among people
	* try mix up your teams
* don't settle for it among places
	* try moving your desk every week to a different location

Explain things
* it forces you to abstract, to reduce things back down into essence
* and look at things systemically
___

# Downsides

Creative people are usually perceived as worse leaders

Usually the people invent a game, are not the ones who make the big bucks
* there are lots of ways to make money and more reliable ways than this
* if you're the first mover, expect the second mover to eat your lunch
	* Blizzard was a very very good second mover

It is risky
* even with all the tips, expect a high fail rate
___

# Why be creative?

It opens up other doors
It's fun
It's how you leave a mark
There is blue ocean, if you do it well enough
It builds your brand, which is important, because marketing is dead
