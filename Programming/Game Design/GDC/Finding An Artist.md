[How to Find and Engage a Great Artist: A Non-Artist Primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDANkhIa7yI)
___

# Before Searching

prepare these things, upfront
* a prototype
	* the most valuable thing you can have at this point
	* don't worry about the visuals
	* use free assets
* an idea of what kind of artist you need
	* you might think you need a modeler, bonus points if knowing how to animate, but what you actually want, might be someone comfortable moving through the visual development process, someone who can do concept art, plan pipelines, do VFX, etc.
	* so think it through, be specific and be ready

* art reference
	* because words are so vague
	* eg. you can make a Pinterest board, fill it up with things that are close or feels close to what you are looking for
* similar to the last point, music can be informative
	* you can make a playlist, and say "hey, this sounds the way the art should look"
* a list of verbs / adjectives that describe the experience

* an idea of your budget
___

# Compensation
about budget

1. the most straight forward way, just have an art budget
* I pay you and you get me the arts

2. Offer royalties, profit sharing
* it's less appealing
* it's even less appealing if you don't have a proof that you ever shipped a game
* because there is risk that that payment never come

3. Interns
* if you don't mind someone with little to no experience, you might be able to get an intern
	* so long you're doing it via their university because they're getting credit
* it can be rough because they're just starting out, but at least you got your arts

4. "Credit", "Experience", "Exposure" are not payment
* don't be an asshole

5. Trade
* you have code, they have arts, then you can trade
* you help them coding, they help you with the arts

6. Allow the artist to retain the rights to their work
* so they can package them up and sell them in places like asset stores
	* ideally you want them to do that after your game is out though
* you might get to approach the artist with a lower price with this, because it's made-up when they get to sell their arts a second time
___

# Work Experience
how good of an artist you can get with a certain amount of budget?

Experienced artists
* higher cost, but you might get to save money in other places
* because they'll be jumping over hurdles that someone more junior might hit
* they can get more done in less time
	* so maybe they are more cost effective

Junior Artists
* it can develop into a long and fruitful relationship
* although they cost less, they are likely to make more mistakes
* but everybody gets better with time!
	* so if you're talking with someone that you really get along with on a personal level, consider putting that time and help them grow
___

# Where to Search

1. Your network
* people you worked with in the past
* people you met at local meetups
* these people are resources, and you can mine that resources
	* it's the whole point of a network

2. Recommendations
* simply find the artists that someone recommends to you
* btw, for this reason, you should build up a good reputation

3. Social media
* search creative hashtags
* send out a help wanted blast
* and again, that's why we need good reputation

4. Industry communities
* eg. Polycount, Cartrdge, forums
___

# Finding the Best Fit

Full time or contract?
* if it's contract, for how long?
* since personal connection is going to become way more important the longer you're going to be working with someone, you would want to make sure that you like the person if you and them are going to work together for years

How specialized are your needs?
* if you're making a pixel art roguelike game, there is a lot of people who can do that
* if you're making something that is more avant-garde, you would have a harder time finding an artist for that and it is likely to cost more money as well

Is the schedule tight?
* if so, then you need someone with experience
* because you don't have many room for mistakes

How senior is the position?
* a production artist with a couple years of experience, that's easier to find and pay for
* but senior positions, like an art director, can take a long time to fill
	* because you are finding someone you know you enjoy working with, and has the experience you need, and you can compensate fairly, and enjoy working on your game, etc.
* so if you're searching for senior level people, you really need to exhaust your search options
* but, you can give a chance to someone slightly junior as well
	* because everybody gets better
	* one thing to be ware of, is that you need to make sure they have a firm grasp of visual design topics, know every arts fundamental concept
		* and other important mindsets, mental skills, etc., as well
* also you can search people from other creative industries as well
	* eg. graphic design and animation are quite close to games

Most importantly, shoot for rapport
* you need to develop close personal connections to the people you're working with eventually
* if you ever need to critique this person's work, you want it to be smooth
	* and it's way smoother if you both respect each other and enjoy each other's company
