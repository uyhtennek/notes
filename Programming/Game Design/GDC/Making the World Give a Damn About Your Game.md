[Making the World Give a Damn About Your Game in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWRu3RRqQmY)

Less than 7% of studios survive their first game release
* and even less actually carry on making games
* but there are plenty of people out there who are happy to buy games

We just need to do the legworks and do the right things

# Descenders
a downhill biking game, from RageSquid

It essentially makes more money in its first month, than
RageSquid previous game made in his lifetime
* secured their future
* the number was around $250,000
* projecting at least $1m in revenue by the end of the year
	* by bringing the game to PS4 and Switch and others

* signed a deal with Xbox for Game Preview
* worked with Oculur on VR version
* active community of thousands on Discord

# The basics
this talk requires you to know the basics, but it doesn't talk about the basics

they are
* writing a press release
.....

# There is no "magic"
it's not all about luck

back when they launch Descenders, they knew that it's gonna sell, because
* they have done all the right things
* they knew how to position it, what to do for the marketing
* they knew at least X number of people will buy the game
	* so eventually, more people than they hope for, brought the game

* maybe that some part of more is luck, but the other part, is not luck

So the "magic" are
1. working out what is exciting about your game
2. giving people a reason to care about your game
3. giving off the "right vibe" about your game
4. reducing risk, rather than relying on luck
5. gritting your teeth and doing those awful, cringy things
6. being realistic about how well your game can do

# 1. the hook

You decided a thing, a feature maybe, that is exciting about your game
It is. But it may not is the only, and the driving exciting thing.

**The Hook vs The Kicker**
your exciting thing, probably is the kicker
the thing is, no one give a damn about the kicker, unless you hook them first

eg. Descenders
* in Descenders, every level is procedurally-generated
	* and they thought this is the selling point
	* if you told people, "this game is procedurally-generated", people would go "yeah, that's cool", but probably not interested so much
* but, if you told people, "that's a extreme downhill freeriding game"
	* that sounds, actually, way more interesting
	* there aren't many downhill mountain biking games, after all
* then you told them, "oh yeah, it got this procedurally generated world thing as well"
	* people go, "omg how does that work!?"
	* so the hook is the driving force, the kicker is one more reason to play or check out the game
* then you can have a conversation, then maybe they'd go and check out some more information

so think about is your selling line sounds interesting?
* anything close to like "Descenders is extreme downhill freeriding through procedurally generated worlds."
* it affects your designs too

# 2. why care your game

After someone has watched your trailer, or visited your website,
where do they go?
* if they got no where to go, they go some where else in the Internet
* six months later you launch your game, no one still remember your trailer

Discord is perfect
