You need to realize that to survive.
The longer you survive, the greater the chance that one day, your game will be special and a hit.

* still here after 11 years
* shipped 10+ games. all made a profit.
	* some are poor, some are okay.
* collected a lot of data

He proposed a better mindset should not be
I want to make a hit game, but,
I want to build a sustainable business.

# Magic Formula
for Game Dev Success

= Make a good game
\+ PR
\+ contacts
\+ luck or magic
___

# What is Success?

* shipping a game
* made a game that some people enjoyed
* made an innovative game or something new
* retire comfortably
* own a Tesla

most people answered
* to continue making games, for a long time

because making games is hard
but we continue making it because we love it
___

# Start small

eg. Bejeweled clone
* except it is Christmas theme
* stock arts

Net revenue $1,800
* not gross revenue
* over a 120 months (10 years) ...

It was a failure
* sold 591 units to date
* cost $170 to make
* took ~250 hours
* $6.50 per hour

eg. another Bejeweled clone
* except it is Easter theme
* custom pixel arts

That was a failure either
* made $2,900 over 10 years
* 558 units, cost $588, 185 hours work, $12.75 per hour


## Life Results
2 failed games lead to financial juggling

* back to job
	* IT consultancy + science writing
* Loans
	* told the bank or government or something it was for home improvement
* used 0% deals from credit cards
* got low income tax credits from government

so lived very frugally
* although, if you want to find a way to survive, you can, like he sort of did
___

# Start with a runway
so, start small isn't the answer, you'll need some kind of runway

You need to make sure you can make it
* before you get your hands dirty
* unless if you're willing to sell your stall or something

back to the story, some guy contacted him to make a public domain IP match 3 game
* the IP was the book The Wizard of Oz
* the guy will pay for all the arts and musics and stuffs
* he just need to code, for free
* then they will share the revenue

he seems legit, so let's do it
* the game did actually turn out very well
* also he then sold the game engine he created on the Blitz Macs forums
	* sold 200 copies for $50 each
	* as a plus, those people helped fixing the engine


## Art and Audio
it's definitely worth spending money on art and audio

if your game looks good, it can sell
* and if your game doesn't look good, people can't equate it with value


## Game Lifetime
back the the IP game again

7 years later, he did a mobile deal with a publisher
then got a big advance on sales

so, any thing can happen in a life time of a game


## Result

* $90,000 net revenue
	* $250,000 gross
* 26,940 units
* cost is $0
* 387 hours work
* $100 per hour

but, it's taken 9 years to get that
* the first year only made $20,000, and it was a flop (= failure)
* so it was a success, but a very long one
___

# The "Long Tail"

so art and audio are important
he then make a Christmas theme match 3 game again
* but paid $2,000 for the arts

it turned out overall has done pretty well
* every Christmas sold many copies
* also, again, the recent 5 years have done better than the first 5 years

Each year, he went back to the casual portals and emailed them to ask for re-promotion
and they did
* if you don't try, you won't get promotion, so you got to try
* some portals wouldn't take the game early on, but later for some reason dropped their standard and took the game

Also, you got to support or improve the game a bit
* did localisation
	* that gave them more opportunities
* did double the levels and made a "GOLD" version
	* did very well and gave the game a new lease of life

so keep your game alive
* there're many ways to do that even after you shipped the game
* but only as long as it makes sense to
	* there may be times that you need to let it die and move on to something else


## Result

* $96,000 net revenue
* 28,655 units
* Cost $2,000
	* = 48x ROI
* 454 hours work
* $200 per hour

but again, it took a long time
* back to the first year, it was
	* 1,056 units sold
	* $5,455 net revenue
* Only 6% of the total net revenue!

So, think "long tail" about your games
* thus, don't heavily discounting or bundling your games in the first year or maybe ever
___

# Contract works
back to the first year, the games didn't make that much money yet

big-fish games contacted him and asked him to do some contract works
he did, and it gave him some money so he paid off the debts

it was like in a first person shooter game, you got all shot up and you need to hide behind a wall, to heal, that's what it was like
* worked on that game for nearly a year
* arts are from a designer from big-fish, John Cutter
* it turned out to be a casual game hit
	* been cloned many times

After that, they ask him for another game
* it was a match 3 game with a theme curing a man
	* the game is called "Unwell Mel"
* it was like Candy Crush, except Candy Crush actually comes later than Unwell Mel
* so choose your theme wisely....

Those two are good, but there are many other contract work offers for him at the time
* some are just bad
* so don't waste time on bad contract works, only choose the good ones

Also, you may want to make sure the contract said you could keep your company, while you work for them

> [!tip] More than just contract works
> Say "Yes" to opportunities.
> Learn to say "No" as well.
> 
> Evaluate them all, in terms of,
> \* will they help me grow?
> \* will they meet my business's long-term goals?
> 
> if they don't, it's just a distraction, so ditch them and move on

___

# Make friends
being part of a like-minded group

it's more than about just networking, so you get the opportunities
it's about making friends as well

it's important to help people out as well
* share information and tips
* then others will share information and tips with you as well

he claimed the main reason he survived, because
other successful developers have helped him out
* Unlike business software development where people need to keep their secrets
* Indies aren't competitive, but collaborative

In addition, don't work in a bubble
* you need ideas from others
___

# Improve
he learnt many from big-fish, and he applied those to his next game

* Used social media to recruit artists
* Crowd-sourced localisation
* Used metrics and testers

also, avoid unhealthy deadlines
* your loved ones might need your time


## Result

* $81,000 net revenue
* 24,891 units
* Cost $2,200 + %
* 500 hours work
* $130 per hour


## Mobile is bad
developers often times came to him and asked "hey would you let me port your game to mobile, and we do a revenues split?"

he tried, it's boring
* they send him these builds
* he tested it, and he needs to send them back feedbacks, and keep testing them
* also you have to do all the iOS provisioning profile crap
* at the end of the day, they don't make that much money

it is not necessarily the case
but 82% of one of his games come from PC, and only 15% from mobile
* 3% from Mac if you're wondering

yeah maybe it just meant that he wan't focusing on mobile
* his skillset lies on desktop games any way
___

# Make your own game

why you should make your own game,
as oppose to keep doing contract works or being an employee?
* being an employee has benefits like you can learn from others, find mentors, and the likes
	* besides medical, sick pay and holiday pay and pension and the likes
	* but it is one of the lowest earning things
		* even if it was a good job
		* the lowest earning thing would be your failed projects
* contract works have fixed ceilings
* you get the most from your own titles
	* assuming you get to that level

In addition, you should track your businesses
* you need to find which of your projects did work, and you should do it again
* when there is an opportunity, think about, "should you be doing that, or your own games?"

You might sacrifice some money by making your own games
because often times other things pay you well

Also, you need to have your eggs in many baskets
* your games can generate income from multiple different revenue streams
* you need to keep up with the new platforms and new things as well because it's an ever-changing space
___

# Don't make decisions out of desperation

eg. he had a mobile game from others and want to port the game to desktop
* it's hard
* it's one of the worst performance project

In addition, remember every game project would take longer than you think it would take
* a game project is never quick
* you need to explore your options very carefully before making your decisions
	* think of the risk, plan a and plan b, etc.
___

# A casual hit
his best-seller is Spooky Bonus, a Halloween match 3 games
* targeted in North America

why did it worked out well?
* small scope
	* took 3 months to make
* resonated 共鳴 with audience
* spent money on art
* no mobile version, just focused on PC
* localised at the beginning
* his 7th match-3 game
* launched at a good time in the casual market
	* gave one of the portals an exclusive deal, it was a great deal.
___

# Get free money
get a grant

You need a good pitch to get a grant, so
* research the market
* research sales data
* sensible budget
* unique but familiar idea
* working demo
* risks and contingencies

basically, they're the foundation of a good business plan
so maybe do that with all of your games

in addition, think of what they can benefit from backing you up


## other funding sources

bank loans or overdraft
* no chance
* bank is not interested

funding from other indie businesses
* money from his friends, probably a some what sucessful indie

personal savings

tax credits
* eg. theirs were tied into making a culturally British game, claimed back 25% of their salaries

crowdfunding
* but he didn't do
	* he'd rather convince one investor that the milestone is delayed, then 10,000 braying kickstarter users

# General tips
for indie sustainability

in your early stage, spend as little as possible
* control your cost
* figure out what you're doing
* learn from your mistakes

then start spending money on the right project
* if you got investments or grants, even better


## Summary

1. he got some flops, early on

2. after that, some minor successes
* some get to be a success 5 or 10 years later
* some get to be success but some body else took all or most of the money

3. in the meanwhile, he got some successes that kept him going


## Minimum Sustainable Success
proposed by Dan Cook

it is an idea that we should make many many games
* so we can survive not just one flop, but many flops in a row
* until hopefully at some point, make a hit
