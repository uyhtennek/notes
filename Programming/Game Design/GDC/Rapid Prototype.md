# Setting a Goal
Is this goal Urgent or Important?

the Important goal is our direction
but all the other Urgent goals will distract us from that
* this is a phenomenon called *Putting out the big fire*
	* because big fires are very dangerous

However, we can use *fires* probably do help us achieving our goal
* ie. all the Urgent tasks help progressing the Important task
* for that, we need to resist putting our the fire immediately
	* instead, nudge it in the right direction to make some value of it

1. first step, setting up a long-term goal, we can use a S.M.A.R.T. for that
* Specific
* Measurable
* Attainable
	* what actions are needed to make it happen
* Relevant
	* how is the goal meaningful and realistic
* Time bound
	* what is the estimated time for completion

eg. making a game jam game
* "I will create a rapid prototype for a game,
* that users will be able to test and offer feedback,
* by signing up for and participating in a Game Jam.
* This would make me a more resourceful dev
* and will be completed in one month's time."

better to set a good goal first
* so when the Urgent tasks come along, you know how to use them

# Strategy

> [!quote] by Arthur Ashe
> Start where you are.
> Use what you have.
> Do what you can.

___

# Vision
the game concept

people tend to focus on the concept more than the design
* which often times is not very helpful
* so we can use a Core Diagram to bring back the balance

It has 4 layers
1. Core Mechanic, the most frequent purposeful interaction
2. Secondary Mechanics, the less frequent interactions
3. Progression, the conditions required for progress, or changes in the game
4. Narrative, the context

eg. Pac-man
1. Move
2. Eat
3. Clear Mazes
4. Eat or be Eaten
___

# Process
it's like exercise or daily routine, so we should have a process that work for ourselves

one of the processes is proposed by Jake Knapp from Google Ventures, called *Sprint*

well not everyone can build a prototype in just one day
* feel free to extend it a little bit
