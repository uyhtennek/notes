This talk is about getting people to notice your game, buy it, and play it (repeatedly)

# Rad Game Factz
facts that about game, the hard-to-swallow pills

* Thousands of games are released every year
	* can see from [Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)](https://ico.org.uk/)
* Some games even have Marketing Budgets
	* which you might not
* And you're competing with ALL of them
	* good or not, big or small, all

but why are we competing?
because of TIME and ATTENTION

> [!quote]
> Your GAME is what customers buy from YOU.
> And TIME is what you buy from THEM.

Therefore, we're not only competing with other games, we're competing with
* everyone else's games, including Fortnite
* Netflix
* Youtube
* Twitter
* Political news

> [!info]- more fact
> 1. Netflix says Fortnite is bigger competition than HBO or Hulu
> 2. Major games publishers are feeling the impact of peaking attention
> 3. They are starting to put little trailers of the trailer you're about to see BEFORE that trailer. It cuts right to explosions because they know that you can't even pay attention for 2 whole minutes now. It haunts me that maybe our brains are broken.


## Average Day of US Adult
in 2018

* 4 hours of phone or tablet
* 4 hours of live TV
	* watching sports or something
* 6.8 hours of sleeping
* 8+ hours at work
	* on weekdays

* check phone 85 times a day
* other life things are not factored yet
	* eg. eating, commuting, bathing, ....

To conclude, we have
* 2 free hours during the weekdays
* 10 free hours on the weekends

# Sell with GIF

Why GIFs are good?
* communicate things quickly
* they're a form of artistic expression
* mobile-friendly, and easily sharable
	* especially on Twitter
	* btw, Twitter users are 31% more likely to remember content, versus other online platforms

So, here we come our first major question
Can your GAME DESIGN fit inside a GIF?
* Can you present your core gameplay loop in a GIF?
* Can you show the 'killer app' of your game in a GIF?
	* the feature or the must-have or must-see thing, that drive people to buy or check the game
	* you might not be able to show the core gameplay loop, but you can show that one powerful moment
		* eg. the T-Rex in Jurassic Park movie
			* the T-Rex is not the focal point of the story, but people go watch the movie because of the T-Rex
			* it can't be just the explosions, because we've seen explosions before, but we don't get to see a T-Rex very often
* Can you teach someone to play your game in a GIF?
	* if people get the gist and understand the GIF, they could start picturing themselves playing the game
	* then we've just won an enormous battle, walked right through a thousand-foot firewall
	* then we're on to the next step of engaging with the customer

So, basically, Can I 'get' your game, in a single GIF?
* can i see it? and can it get it?

> [!info] grok (verb)
> understand (something) intuitively or by empathy
> 
> eg. "player is grok to your game"
> = they're really into it, they really get it
> = they're in a position where they can evangelize 播道 it
> = they're willing to put up with some bull shit, in order to get more of that experience, because they bought into it

Here, we want player to grok to our GIF
___

## "What do you want the player to feel?"
how can we do that, boils down to this question

Ask that about every aspect of our game design, everything that we put in the game
* every decision that we make, every feature that we put in
* we should ask what is the emotional context on the part of the player here, "how they feel?" and "what do we want them to feel?"

We don't just ask this question in game design, we too ask the same question when we show the game to people on social media
	* people make GIFs of their gameplay all the time
	* but are you asking yourself, what is it that I'm looking for the person looking at the GIF to feel in response to it
		* because we don't just show random thing, we show things that make people feel
		* also it might change the game that we're making if we can't answer that question

> [!quote] Always ask that question
> You should always have something that you're trying to say.
> If you don't, you're just another game, just another entry in a genre. You're not saying anything different.


## Why this is important?

because everyone is distracted all the time
* we have a finite amount of time and energy to care about new things
* the more time and energy is required, the harder to sell

we're not just talking about game sale here
it's about when people saw our game, will they want to know more

So, reduce time-to-grok as much as possible!

eg. we're selling burgers
* if we just set up a stall, and making burgers, but we didn't put up a sign, a menu, or anything, it is going to be really hard to sell those burgers
* if we put up a sign that said "burgers for sale"
	* now people have context, they know what it is you're trying to sell
* if we provide a picture of our delicious burger, and some reviews
	* we're answering questions that people might have, even if they're just in their head
	* we're giving them knowledge, the knowledge that lead to either wanting to know more or eventually a sale
___

## Examples
go look at GIFs from those games

* Spelunky
	* it shows some fun by failing, because some mechanics of the game happen in sequences and generate a comical or funny outcome
* Superhot
	* it shows time only moves when you do

btw, Superhot is great to show the difference between complex design and complex idea
* generally, avoid complex ideas, because they're hard to convey or sell
* instead, do simple idea but complex execution or complex design
	* Portal would probably be the master class in this

Players will just start thinking about the game and all the different things that they can do, and how they might play the game, when they see GIFs like Portal and Superhot
* it's a huge advantage
* eg. games from Nintendo Power back in the days
	* just have screenshots to go by and really bad descriptions about the screenshots
	* but people would make up in their head, what the game could possibly be about, and then got themselve excited
		* it is all lies that we were telling ourselve though
		* but that's okay, because people are excited

* Rocket League
	* if I just told you, "we got cars that play soccer", and you have never heard of Rocket League before, it's likely that people would be imagining a very awkward version of soccer
	* Rocket League doesn't have too much things going on, but it can have many ways to play out, and it's exciting
		* and it gets right to the point, and it's a huge hit
* Human Fall Flat
	* it doesn't show awesomeness, but awkwardness and silliness
	* but comedy, is great for GIFs
		* it makes it very shareable
	* but it needs room for extrapolation
		* if we have great joke, but no way for people to understand how it relates to the game, people are left with nothing
		* people won't want to know more, so they just scroll away, instead of go watch the trailer or watch some more GIFs about the game, or buy the game
	* Once people go learn more about the game, they immediately get that Human Fall Flat is about mundane things, stuipidly and without consequences
		* if it sounds fun to them, they will buy the game
* Subnautica
	* it's killer app, is the moment when the play dive into underwater
		* it is a breathtaking moment, to dive below the surface of the sea, and seeing a massive mysterious underwater world, for us to explore
	* it also has that mystery element
		* so people would want to know more and see more
* Factorio
	* it shows simply, scale
		* scale of things that we can do in it
	* also, they decided to show known machinery
		* like oil derricks, spaceships, ....
		* which is important, because people can understand and relate to
			* it bridges a road for people to understand more about the game
			* if everything were just alien machinery, people wouldn't get it at all, so why bother learning more
	* if Rocket League is UFOs hitting a nova cube, it is quite confusing for the people
		* "are they playing soccer?"
		* but since Rocket League is playing soccer, people can get it very fast
			* "oh they're playing soccer, but just with cars"
* They Are Billions
	* also about scale and quantity, but also the scale of the enemy
	* the killer app is that, billions of zombies coming at once
	* Slime Rancher also has hordes and hordes of slimes bumping into one another
	* zombie, slime, are things that are very common, but since many many many of those is not something we get to see regularly, the games feel different
* Monster Hunter
	* "if you can do the giant T-Rex, you should absolutely do the giant T-Rex"
	* they focus on the monsters instead of the player
		* their marketing narrative is very very consistent in that regard
		* the gameplay GIFs from them are usually "little strong warrior fighting enormous monsters, and it seems very overwhelming"
* Slime Rancher
	* the action comes at the screen
	* the art is bright and cheery and very easy to parse
		* especially if you're just scrolling through on something like Twitter
	* has interesting physics
* Baba Is You
	* a indie pixel art turn-based puzzle game is probably not something that a mainstream gamer audience is going to care about
	* but, it teaches perfectly how to play the game, in a GIF
		* immediately we'd start thinking about all the different permutations
		* probably contributes hugely to its success

> [!warning]
> "Plenty of best-selling games, don't do this."


## In Summary

* Customers have finite time and are highly distracted
* So make a game that customers don't have to work to understand
* Make a game that sells itself in the span of a GIF

also, if we do this from the beginning, it will affect our game design
* because we have to be lean and focused, in order to do this

> [!tip]
> "Knowledge equals sales."

# Staying Relevant

what is staying relevant?
* having new content, to play over time
* remaining community-relevant, over time
* remaining streamer- or YouTube-relevant, over time
* Goal: continuing to sell, over time

> [!tip] Takeaway
> Your game needs a pulse to survive.
> 
> Games with a beating heart have a far better chance of staying on the charts. And very rarely does anyone these days release a game and just walk away from it and six months later it's still a best-seller. (unless you're Nintendo)


## How to keep the pulse?

Firstly, we have 2 major ones
1. Content updates
2. Multiplayer or sharing feature
if we used both of those, it's the most powerful cocktail

There are others
* Content creation from your community
	* if you've released a tool set, and foster that, and players are able to make their own content
* Community scene / competition
	* pretty much requires multiplayer though
* Porting to other platforms
	* especially if you're releasing special or deluxe edition, as you port it to new platforms
	* basically, try to treat every port as a new launch
		* so use more opportunity to scream about it again
		* not just "now it's available on this platform, thank you, good night"
* Community engagement
