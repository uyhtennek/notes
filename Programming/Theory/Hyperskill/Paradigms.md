___

# Imperative paradigm

the oldest programming paradigms
* it's a sequence of instructions that the processor must execute step by step
* it focuses on how to achieve a goal

eg. if we want to display `"Hello, <username>!"` on the screen, what are the steps?
1. ask the username
2. read and remember the username
3. display the result
___

## Procedural programming paradigm

it's the concept of having a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step
* with the aid of procedures
	* procedures = subroutines or functions

* the computer takes input data and processes it sequentially, remembering each new change
* suitable for general-purpose programming to complete common tasks
	* eg. calculating a factorial, finding the area of a figure, displaying some information like `"Hello, world!"`
* eg. C, C++, Java, ColdFusion, Pascal
___

## Object-oriented programming
or OOP

program is written as a collection of classes
* class instances are called objects
* a class is a way of describing an entity
	* defining the usual state and behavior that depends on that state

eg. a `Cat` class
* it has attributes like a tail, paws, claws, muzzle, ears, whiskers
* it can run, jump, meow, eat, rip off the wallpaper

OOP can handle almost all kinds of common real-life problems
* it can represent typical objects and work with them

eg. Ruby, Java, C++, Python, Smalltalk, Visual Basic .NET, Objective-C
* Simula is the first OOP language
___

## Parallel processing approach

it shares or parallelizes instructions across multiple processors
* so it reduces instruction execution time

eg. NESL, one of the oldest
eg. C / C++, supported by some libraries
___

# Declarative paradigm

in which, it's important to specify the problem and the expected result of its solution
* imperative paradigm asks "How to do this?"
* declarative paradigm asks "What needs to be done?" and "What will be the result of the work?"
* we don't need to provide step-by-step instructions, we tell the system what we need and it will try to come up with a solution
___

## Logic programming paradigm
