The speaker said 'great, i will give it to you. but first let me do something with this.' Then he crumpled that bill badly. And asked 'now any one wants to have it?' Still many hands were raised.
'Okay.' The speaker then crushed the note on ground with his feet. He picked it up and asked again 'It is crumpled and dirty now. still anyone there who wants to have it?' Few hands were still raised.
