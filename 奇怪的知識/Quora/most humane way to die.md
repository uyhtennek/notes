# breath hydrogen
Our lung is kind of stupid that it can't name any gas other than carbon dioxide. so as long as we are breathing hydrogen, we will not suffocate.
We will just gradually feel tired because the body is lacking oxygen. Then we will fall a sleep and eventually die. There is no pain in the whole process. (excluding the stress from knowing that we are dying)
