Inverse Square Law

Think of a star, and imagine putting up an enormous sheet of paper about one astronomical unit away. The star'll light up a certain area of the sheet of paper.
Now take that paper and put it two astronomical unit away. The area that the star lights up will be twice as tall and twice as wide, but it's the same amount of light hitting it -- the same number of photons, only spread out over an area four times as big.
That means if you look at a small area of the sheet of paper, only one-fourth as many photons are hitting it, so it looks one-fourth as bright. If you look at it from ten times as far away, it looks one one-hundredth as bright.

> The further away you get, the fewer photons have a chance of reaching your eyes.

> Only the photons form the closest and brightest stars make it to your eyes. The rest of the sky looks dark.

> People have collected huge pools of gallium, put them deep underground, and it turns out that thirty tons of the stuff -- thirty TONS -- will catach ONE neutrino a day. The neutrino will turn ONE atom of gallium into germanium. All the other billions and billions of neutrinos just go streaming right through the earth. But you can't see them, because they go right through your eyes.

Where do gallium comes frome?
> You know what a star is, right?
> It's a big ball of hydrogen being fused into hellium.

> Right. Now, eventually the hydrogen runs out. What happens to the helium left over? Some of it gets expeleed out into space, and the rest of it contracts even tighter, till the HELIUM starts to fuse. So the star lights up again, turning helium into carbon, and then into oxygen. And the process keeps going -- some of the matter is expelled into space, the rest keeps contracting, fusing, into neon, magnesium, silicon, and eventually, into iron. Iron is pretty much the most stable thing there is. Right now hydrogen is the most common substance there is, but if you wait long enough, it'll be iron.

> Now, iron is element #26, and gallium is #31, so you'll never get to gallium that way. Heavy elements like gallium, or gold, are produced in supernovae -- they're formed when stars explode, and fly out into space.

> But that's also an important thing to keep in mind when you think about this stuff. One bit of pure gold is exactly the same as any other bit of pure gold -- the substance behaves the same way. So from one point of view, any particular piece of gold isn't valuable at all, since you can always get another. You can even replace your iridium. But Michael Crichton notwithstanding, you can't get back any of the dinosaurs.

> You're not made of a whole lot that's particularly exotic -- the only stuff heavier than iron, the only things you'd need a supernova for, are trace elements: a little iodine to keep the goiter away, that kind of thing. You're made mainly of the most common star stuff: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen. But you can't just trade yourself in for a sack of carbon and oxygen and hydrogen the way you can trade gold for gold. What makes you you is the way that star stuff is arranged, and that's totally unique. Which makes you more valuable than all the gold from all the stars in the sky.
